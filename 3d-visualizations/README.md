## **🎯 Scoring System Overview**

Each test problem is assigned a complexity score ranging from **1** to **10**. These scores reflect the relative difficulty of the problem, taking into account factors such as:

- **📚 Conceptual Complexity:** The level of mathematical or scientific understanding required.  
- **💻 Coding Challenge:** The difficulty of implementing the solution and building interactive visualizations.  
- **⚙️ Computation Requirements:** The resources needed to execute simulations or computations effectively.

A lower score (e.g., **1–4**) indicates a **beginner-friendly** problem, while higher scores (e.g., **8–10**) represent more advanced challenges suited for experienced individuals.

### **✨ Important Note for Beginners**  
Although some problems are marked as "beginner-friendly," this repository assumes that participants have a **baseline understanding** of Python and related tools. Before attempting any test problem, it’s recommended that participants:  
- Know how to set up **Python environments** (e.g., virtual environments).  
- Understand how to use `pip` to install packages.  
- Be familiar with the role and structure of `requirements.txt` files.  
- Have some experience running Python scripts and troubleshooting basic errors.  

This repository is meant for individuals who already have foundational Python skills and are looking to expand their knowledge by tackling challenging problems.
