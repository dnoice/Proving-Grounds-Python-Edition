## üìù Problem Title

**Interactive 3D Clustering for Multivariate Data Analysis: An Exploratory Data Challenge**

*Instructions:*  
Develop a Python-based tool or Jupyter Notebook that processes multivariate datasets, reduces their dimensionality to three principal components, and applies clustering algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering. The final output should include an interactive 3D visualization that enables users to explore and manipulate the clusters in real time.

## üåç Scenario

High-dimensional datasets often hide intricate patterns that are not immediately visible. By employing dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE, the data can be mapped into a 3D space where cluster structures become apparent. In this challenge, you will integrate clustering and interactive 3D visualization to explore the data, validate cluster separability, and gain insights into the underlying feature relationships.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Data Preprocessing and Dimensionality Reduction**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Import and clean the multivariate dataset, handling missing values and scaling features appropriately.  
   - **Task 1-b:** Apply a dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., PCA or t-SNE) to transform the dataset into three dimensions suitable for 3D visualization.

2. **Clustering Implementation**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Implement one or more clustering algorithms (such as K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering) on the reduced dataset.  
   - **Task 2-b:** Evaluate the clustering performance using metrics like silhouette scores or inertia, and determine the optimum number of clusters where applicable.

3. **Interactive 3D Visualization**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Create an interactive 3D plot (using libraries like Plotly or interactive features in Matplotlib) to display the clustered data points.  
   - **Task 3-b:** Incorporate interactive elements such as dropdown menus, sliders, or checkboxes that allow users to adjust clustering parameters or select between different dimensionality reduction methods.  
   - **Task 3-c:** Annotate the visualization with additional details such as cluster centroids or labels to enhance interpretability.

4. **Analysis and Reporting**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Document your methodology, including rationale for selecting particular dimensionality reduction and clustering methods.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Provide a comparative analysis of the clustering outcomes and discuss insights derived from the interactive visualization.

## üéÅ Bonus Section (Advanced Challenge)

1. **Enhanced Parameter Tuning:**  
   - Develop an interactive dashboard that provides real-time feedback of clustering metrics as users adjust parameters like the number of clusters or the choice of dimensionality reduction technique.

2. **Multiple Dimensionality Reduction Options:**  
   - Allow users to toggle between different dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) and observe how each technique affects the clustering output.

3. **Web Application Deployment:**  
   - Package the interactive visualization tool as a standalone web application using frameworks such as Dash or Streamlit to broaden accessibility.

*Bonus Deliverables:*  
- An advanced interactive dashboard showcasing multiple reduction techniques with real-time clustering performance.  
- A discussion report on the comparative effects of dimensionality reduction choices on cluster interpretability.
