# 🛠️ Cluster Craze: Interactive 3D Clustering for Multivariate Data Analysis

---

## 📋 Overview
Clustering is a powerful technique for grouping similar data points based on their features. When dealing with multivariate data, visualizing clusters in three dimensions can provide deeper insights into the structure and relationships within the data. In this challenge, you will develop an interactive 3D clustering tool that allows users to explore clusters, adjust parameters, and visualize how data points group together in real time.

---

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you’re part of a data science team analyzing customer behavior based on various attributes like spending patterns, age, and location. To make strategic decisions, you need to group similar customers into clusters and visualize these clusters interactively to better understand patterns. Your tool will allow users to adjust clustering parameters on the fly and observe how the clusters change.

The challenge? Keep the visualization responsive and allow real-time manipulation of cluster settings, including the number of clusters and the clustering method used.
