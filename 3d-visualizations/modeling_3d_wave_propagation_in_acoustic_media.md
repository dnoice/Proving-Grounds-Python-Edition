# Modeling 3D Wave Propagation in Acoustic Media

This challenge focuses on simulating the propagation of acoustic waves in a three-dimensional medium. Participants will develop a Python-based simulation that solves the 3D wave equation using numerical methods (e.g., Finite Difference Time Domain), implements absorbing boundary conditions, and visualizes the resulting wave dynamics.

## üìù Problem Title

**Modeling 3D Wave Propagation in Acoustic Media: A Computational Acoustics Challenge**

*Instructions:*  
Develop a Python simulation to model the propagation of acoustic waves in 3D space. Your task is to implement the 3D wave equation, apply appropriate numerical methods for time and space discretization, and visualize the wave evolution and reflections within the acoustic medium.

## üåç Scenario

Sound waves propagate through different media following the principles of wave dynamics governed by the 3D acoustic wave equation. In this challenge, you are tasked with simulating the behavior of an acoustic wave in a defined spatial domain. This includes setting up the computational grid, defining the physical properties of the medium (such as sound speed and density), and handling boundary conditions to minimize reflections (for example, through the use of absorbing boundaries). This simulation will provide insights into phenomena such as interference, diffraction, and the effect of obstacles within the medium.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Domain Setup and Parameter Definition**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Define a 3D computational domain with specified grid resolutions in the x, y, and z directions.  
   - **Task 1-b:** Specify the physical parameters such as the speed of sound, medium density, and the initial conditions (e.g., a localized pressure pulse).

2. **Discretization and Numerical Scheme**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Derive the 3D acoustic wave equation and discretize it using a suitable finite difference method (e.g., FDTD).  
   - **Task 2-b:** Implement the time-stepping algorithm (such as the leapfrog method or another stable integration scheme) to update the acoustic pressure field.

3. **Boundary Conditions and Stability**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Implement absorbing boundary conditions (such as Perfectly Matched Layers or sponge layers) to minimize reflections from the domain boundaries.  
   - **Task 3-b:** Analyze the numerical stability and convergence of your scheme by testing different grid resolutions and time step sizes.

4. **Visualization and Wave Analysis**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Generate 3D visualizations of the pressure field over time using libraries such as Matplotlib (with `mplot3d`) or Plotly.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Create animations or interactive plots that allow the observation of wave propagation, interference patterns, and decay characteristics.
   - **Task 4-c:** Annotate key events in the simulation, such as the peak intensity points and the effect of boundary absorption.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**  
   - **Task 5-a:** Clearly document your methodology, including the derivation of the numerical scheme and the rationale behind chosen parameters.  
   - **Task 5-b:** Summarize your findings in a brief report, discussing the impact of grid resolution, time step size, and absorbing boundary efficiency on the simulation accuracy.
