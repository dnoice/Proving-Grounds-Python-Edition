# 🛠️ Sound Waves in Space: Modeling 3D Wave Propagation in Acoustic Media

---

## 📋 Overview
Simulating wave propagation in a 3D acoustic medium is essential for applications ranging from architectural acoustics to underwater sonar systems. This challenge will focus on building a 3D model to visualize how sound waves travel through different materials. You’ll implement the wave equation in three dimensions and create a dynamic visualization to observe wave fronts, reflections, and damping effects.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you’re designing a sound system for a concert hall. You need to predict how sound waves propagate through the space, accounting for reflections from walls, absorption by surfaces, and interference patterns. Your goal is to build a 3D simulation that models how sound behaves when emitted from various sources, helping optimize speaker placement and acoustic treatment.

The challenge? The medium isn’t uniform – different materials alter wave speed and damping, requiring adaptive modeling.
