# Real-Time 3D Particle Swarm Optimization Visualization

This challenge involves implementing a real-time particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in a 3D environment. Participants will simulate a swarm of particles searching a complex, multimodal function, compute the global minimum, and visualize the movement and convergence behavior in an interactive 3D display.

## üìù Problem Title

**Real-Time 3D Particle Swarm Optimization Visualization: An Interactive Optimization Challenge**

*Instructions:*  
Develop a Python-based simulation that employs the PSO algorithm to minimize a given multimodal function in three dimensions. The simulation should animate the evolution of the particle swarm in real time, updating their positions based on the PSO update rules. Interactive controls should be integrated to adjust key parameters such as inertia, cognitive, and social coefficients during the simulation.

## üåç Scenario

Optimizing complex functions with many local minima is a common task in computational optimization. In this challenge, you will simulate how a swarm of particles explores a three-dimensional search space to locate the global minimum of a function, such as the Rastrigin or similar benchmark function. The dynamic 3D visualization will provide insights into the convergence behavior of the swarm and the influence of algorithm parameters on performance.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Define the Problem and Initialize Parameters**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Choose a benchmark multimodal function (e.g., Rastrigin function) defined in 3D space and set the search domain (e.g., each dimension in [-5.12, 5.12]).  
   - **Task 1-b:** Initialize a swarm of particles with random positions and velocities within the search domain.  
   - **Task 1-c:** Define PSO parameters including inertia weight (w), cognitive coefficient (c1), and social coefficient (c2).

2. **Implement the PSO Algorithm**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Formulate the velocity and position update equations for each particle:
     
     ```
     v_i(t+1) = w * v_i(t) + c1 * r1 * (p_best_i - x_i(t)) + c2 * r2 * (g_best - x_i(t))
     x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + v_i(t+1)
     ```
     
     where r1 and r2 are random numbers between 0 and 1.
   - **Task 2-b:** Program a loop to iterate through particle updates until a termination condition (e.g., maximum iterations or convergence) is met.
   - **Task 2-c:** Update individual best (p_best) and global best (g_best) positions based on the function evaluations.

3. **Develop the Real-Time 3D Visualization**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Use visualization libraries such as Plotly or Matplotlib‚Äôs `mplot3d` to create an interactive 3D plot that displays the particle positions.  
   - **Task 3-b:** Animate the particle movements over iterations and include annotations for the current global best position.
   - **Task 3-c:** Integrate interactive controls (e.g., sliders) that allow users to adjust PSO parameters (w, c1, c2) on the fly, with the visualization updating in real time.

4. **Analysis and Reporting**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Record and report on the number of iterations required for convergence and the final value of the optimized function.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Discuss how changes in PSO parameters affect the convergence rate and solution quality.  
   - **Task 4-c:** Provide clear documentation of the code, explaining the implementation details and design choices.
