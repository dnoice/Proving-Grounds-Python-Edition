# 🛠️ Swarming in Style: Real-Time 3D Particle Swarm Optimization Visualization

---

## 📋 Overview
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) mimics the collective intelligence of swarms, like flocks of birds or schools of fish, to find optimal solutions in complex spaces. Visualizing this in 3D gives you a front-row seat to the dance of particles as they converge toward the best solution. In this challenge, you’ll develop an interactive, real-time 3D visualization that tracks particle movement, convergence patterns, and optimization progress.

## 🌍 Scenario
You’ve been recruited by a data science lab to build a tool that visualizes how PSO algorithms work in real time. Researchers need to see how particles move, swarm, and adapt when solving high-dimensional optimization problems. Your mission? Create an interactive 3D visualization where users can tweak PSO parameters on the fly and watch how the swarm’s behavior changes. 

The twist? The optimization landscape is rugged – local minima abound, and particles must work together to avoid being trapped. Make the visuals dynamic, the interaction intuitive, and the insights crystal clear.
