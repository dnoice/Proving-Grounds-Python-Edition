# 🛠️ Growing the Unseen: Simulating 3D Cellular Growth and Tissue Expansion

---

## 📋 Overview
Biological tissues are living, dynamic entities that grow, expand, and adapt. Modeling cellular growth in three dimensions can give insights into tissue engineering, tumor development, and even regenerative medicine. In this challenge, you’ll simulate the bizarre yet fascinating process of 3D cellular growth, visualizing how cells divide, cluster, and expand over time.

## 🌍 Scenario
You’ve been recruited by a biotech startup exploring artificial tissue growth for medical implants. Your mission is to model how cells proliferate and cluster within a 3D medium. The simulation must account for cellular interactions, density limitations, and expansion dynamics. 

The challenge? Some cells migrate while others remain static, and nutrient availability affects growth speed. Your visualization must capture the chaotic yet structured dance of cellular expansion while allowing real-time adjustments to growth factors.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Setting Up the Cellular Growth Model
Start by defining the cellular growth process mathematically and setting up the environment.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🧠 Define a cell as a particle in 3D space, represented by coordinates and state (dividing, migrating, dormant).
- 🪶 Implement a basic growth rule: cells divide based on proximity and nutrient availability.
- 🪵 Set up initial conditions with a small cluster of seed cells at the center.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A foundational model that simulates basic cellular growth in a 3D space.

### 🔬 Task 2: Modeling Cell Interactions and Dynamics
Make the growth more realistic by adding interactions and movement.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌱 Implement rules for cell division: proximity-based inhibition and nutrient-dependent speed.
- 🌀 Add cellular migration for a subset of cells, simulating random or gradient-driven movement.
- 💥 Introduce cell death when overcrowding occurs, maintaining realistic tissue density.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A dynamic system where cells grow, divide, migrate, and die based on local conditions.
