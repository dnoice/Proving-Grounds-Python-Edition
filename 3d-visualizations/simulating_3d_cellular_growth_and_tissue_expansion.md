# Simulating 3D Cellular Growth and Tissue Expansion

This challenge focuses on designing a computational model to simulate the growth of cells within a three-dimensional environment. The goal is to develop an agent-based or continuum simulation that captures cell proliferation, migration, and interactions while modeling tissue expansion over time.

## üìù Problem Title

**Simulating 3D Cellular Growth and Tissue Expansion: A Computational Biology Challenge**

*Instructions:*  
Develop a Python-based simulation that models the dynamics of cellular growth in a 3D microenvironment. Your simulation should incorporate cell proliferation, cell-cell interactions, and diffusion of nutrients or signaling molecules that influence tissue expansion.

## üåç Scenario

Understanding how tissues expand and develop is a critical question in developmental biology and cancer research. In this challenge, you will create a simulation that represents a tissue as a three-dimensional domain populated with individual cells. Each cell should follow a set of biologically inspired rules for division, migration, and interaction with neighbors, as well as respond to gradients of nutrients or growth factors. The simulation aims to reveal insights into spatial growth patterns, contact inhibition, and the emergence of complex tissue structures.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Simulation Setup and Initialization**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Define a 3D computational grid or continuous space representing the tissue environment.  
   - **Task 1-b:** Initialize a set of cells with defined positions, sizes, and biological properties (e.g., proliferation rate, adhesion strength).  
   - **Task 1-c:** Set initial conditions for external factors such as nutrient concentration or growth factor gradients.

2. **Modeling Cellular Dynamics and Interactions**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Implement rules for cell proliferation and division. Include conditions such as reaching a size threshold or sufficient nutrient availability.  
   - **Task 2-b:** Model cell-cell interactions such as contact inhibition, adhesion, and mechanical forces that restrain cell movement.  
   - **Task 2-c:** (Optional) Incorporate a diffusion-reaction model to simulate the transport and uptake of nutrients or signaling molecules within the tissue.

3. **Time Evolution and Simulation Execution**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Develop a time-stepping algorithm to update cell positions, states, and interactions based on the implemented rules.  
   - **Task 3-b:** Track key metrics over time such as cell count, tissue volume, and spatial distribution.
   - **Task 3-c:** Ensure that the simulation remains numerically stable and efficient for large 3D domains.

4. **Visualization and Analysis**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Create 3D visualizations of the tissue structure using libraries such as Matplotlib (with `mplot3d`) or Plotly.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Animate the simulation to observe cellular growth and tissue expansion over time.  
   - **Task 4-c:** Analyze growth patterns, identifying regions of high proliferation or migration, and discuss the emerging tissue morphology.

## üì¶ Deliverables

- **üíª Code Implementation:**  
  - A Python script or Jupyter Notebook with the complete simulation code, including well-documented functions and clear comments.
  
- **üìä Analysis Report:**  
  - A report summarizing the simulation approach, key assumptions, growth patterns observed, and metrics derived from the simulation results.
  
- **üñºÔ∏è Visualizations:**  
  - Dynamic 3D plots and animations showing the evolution of the tissue, annotated with descriptions of key events (e.g., bursts of proliferation).

## üéÅ Bonus Section (Advanced Challenge)

1. **Multicellular Differentiation:**  
   - Extend the simulation by introducing multiple cell types with distinct properties (e.g., different proliferation rates or adhesion qualities) and simulate tissue heterogeneity.

2. **Interactive Parameter Tuning:**  
   - Develop an interactive dashboard (using tools like Streamlit or Plotly Dash) that allows users to adjust parameters in real time (e.g., nutrient levels, cell adhesion) and observe the resulting changes in tissue growth dynamics.

3. **Mechanical Feedback Integration:**  
   - Incorporate feedback mechanisms where mechanical stress influences cell behavior (e.g., altering proliferation or inducing apoptosis) to better mimic in vivo tissue development.

*Bonus Deliverables:*  
- An extended analysis report that includes comparisons between simulations with homogeneous and heterogeneous cell populations.
- An interactive tool for real-time experimentation with simulation parameters.
