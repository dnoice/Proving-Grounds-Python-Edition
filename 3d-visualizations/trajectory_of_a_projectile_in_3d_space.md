## üìù Problem Title

**Trajectory of a Projectile in 3D Space: A Simulation and Analysis Challenge**

*Instructions:*  
Develop a Python-based simulation that computes the trajectory of a projectile launched into 3D space. Your task is to calculate the projectile's path using the relevant equations of motion under gravitational influence, and then visualize the trajectory with dynamic 3D plots.

## üåç Scenario

In many real-world applications‚Äîfrom sports physics to aerospace engineering‚Äîunderstanding projectile motion is essential. In this challenge, you will simulate a projectile's flight by taking into account its initial speed, launch angles, and gravity. The simulation should capture the entire flight path until the projectile returns to the ground. This provides a foundation for studying more complex ballistic trajectories and the effects of additional forces like drag.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Defining Initial Conditions and Equations of Motion**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Specify the initial conditions, including:
     - Initial speed (v‚ÇÄ)
     - Launch angles (azimuth and elevation)
     - Initial position in 3D space
   - **Task 1-b:** Derive the analytical equations of motion for the projectile in the absence of air resistance:
     - x(t) = x‚ÇÄ + v‚ÇÄ * cos(elevation) * cos(azimuth) * t
     - y(t) = y‚ÇÄ + v‚ÇÄ * cos(elevation) * sin(azimuth) * t
     - z(t) = z‚ÇÄ + v‚ÇÄ * sin(elevation) * t - 0.5 * g * t¬≤
   - **Task 1-c:** Define the gravitational acceleration constant (g) and decide on the coordinate system.

2. **Numerical Simulation**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Implement a numerical integration method (such as Euler‚Äôs method or Runge-Kutta methods) to compute the projectile‚Äôs position over time.
   - **Task 2-b:** Determine the flight duration and apply a termination condition when the projectile reaches the ground level.
   - **Task 2-c:** Ensure that the simulation computes a sufficient number of time steps to capture a smooth trajectory.

3. **3D Visualization of the Trajectory**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Create interactive 3D plots using visualization libraries such as Plotly or Matplotlib‚Äôs `mplot3d` to render the projectile path.
   - **Task 3-b:** Include axis labels, a legend, and annotations for key events (e.g., peak height, landing point).
   - **Task 3-c:** *(Optional)* Add interactive controls (e.g., sliders) to adjust initial conditions and visualize how the trajectory changes in real time.

4. **Analysis and Reporting**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Document the simulation methodology, including derivation of the equations and the numerical integration scheme.
   - **Task 4-b:** Analyze key metrics such as maximum height, range, and total flight time, and compare with theoretical predictions.
   - **Task 4-c:** Discuss potential extensions to the model, such as incorporating air resistance or wind effects.

## üéÅ Bonus Section (Advanced Challenge)

1. **Air Resistance Integration:**  
   - Modify the simulation to include air resistance. Implement a drag model (e.g., quadratic air resistance) and analyze its effect on the trajectory.

2. **Wind Influence:**  
   - Incorporate wind velocity as an additional force affecting the projectile and compare the differences compared to the idealized case.

3. **Extended Analysis:**  
   - Perform sensitivity analysis on how changes in launch angles and initial speed affect the maximum height and range.  
   - Use optimization techniques to determine the best launch conditions for achieving a desired range or maximum height.

*Bonus Deliverables:*  
- A modified simulation with air resistance and wind effects integrated.
- An extended report that compares the idealized and drag-influenced trajectories, including sensitivity analyses.
