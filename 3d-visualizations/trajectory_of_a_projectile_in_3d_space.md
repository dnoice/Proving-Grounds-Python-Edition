# 🛠️ Precision in Motion: Trajectory of a Projectile in 3D Space

---

## 📋 Overview
Projectile motion in 3D space is a classic problem in physics, blending gravity, initial velocity, and launch angles into a dynamic path. Understanding how objects move through space is crucial in fields like ballistics, sports analytics, and even game physics. In this challenge, you will simulate the trajectory of a projectile under gravity, visualizing its path in three dimensions.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you’re working on a physics-based game where players can launch objects from various angles and speeds. You need to calculate the projectile’s path accurately while accounting for gravitational pull and initial momentum. Your goal is to build a real-time visualization that shows the projectile’s trajectory, allowing users to tweak parameters like launch speed, angle, and gravity. 

The twist? Introduce air resistance and varying gravitational fields to simulate more realistic scenarios.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Setting Up the Mathematical Model
Establish the equations of motion to simulate projectile trajectory.

**Sub-tasks:**
