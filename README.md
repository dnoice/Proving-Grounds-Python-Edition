## **üìÇ Example Problem: 3D-Visualizations**

**Note** This is a very simplified version.

### **Problem Title: Interactive 3D Clustering for Multivariate Data Analysis**

- **Scenario**: Develop a Python-based tool to analyze high-dimensional datasets, project them into 3D space using dimensionality reduction techniques, and identify clusters using algorithms such as k-means or DBSCAN. Visualize the results with interactive 3D plots.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Preprocess the data and apply dimensionality reduction.
  2. Perform clustering and analyze the resulting groups.
  3. Create an interactive visualization to showcase clustering results.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Python script or Jupyter Notebook with commented code.
  - 3D plots showing clustering outcomes.
  - Insights on clustering performance and data representation.
