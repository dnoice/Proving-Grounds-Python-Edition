## üìù Problem Title

**Calculating the Aerodynamics of Airfoils: A Computational Challenge**

*Instructions:*  
Develop a Python-based simulation that computes the aerodynamic characteristics of a chosen airfoil (e.g., a NACA series profile). Your goal is to derive and visualize the lift coefficient and pressure distribution, ultimately investigating how changes in flight conditions (like angle of attack) influence airfoil performance.

## üåç Scenario

Imagine you are an aerospace engineer tasked with evaluating the performance of an airfoil under a variety of conditions. In this challenge, you will simulate the flow around the airfoil using computational methods such as the panel method or potential flow theory. By approximating the distribution of circulation along the airfoil surface, you will not only compute the lift via the Kutta‚ÄìJoukowski theorem but also visualize the pressure distribution and flow patterns. This problem bridges theoretical fluid dynamics and practical coding skills, offering insights into both simulation technique and aerodynamic design.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Airfoil Geometry and Flow Conditions**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Define the airfoil geometry. Use either provided coordinates for a standard airfoil (e.g., NACA 2412) or generate the profile using the mathematical formulation of NACA airfoils.
   - **Task 1-b:** Specify free-stream conditions, including velocity, air density, and an adjustable angle of attack.

2. **Panel Method Setup**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Divide the airfoil surface into a finite number of panels.  
   - **Task 2-b:** Compute the influence coefficients for each panel to capture the effect of vortex elements on the flow around the airfoil.

3. **Solving for Circulation and Pressure Distribution**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Establish and solve the linear system derived from enforcing the no-penetration condition on the airfoil surface.  
   - **Task 3-b:** Use the computed circulation values to calculate the local pressure coefficients across the surface.

4. **Computation of Aerodynamic Coefficients**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Apply the Kutta‚ÄìJoukowski theorem to derive the lift coefficient (CL) from the circulation distribution.
   - **Task 4-b:** Optionally, incorporate simplified viscous models to approximate the drag coefficient (CD).

5. **Visualization and Analysis**  
   - **Task 5-a:** Create visualizations:
     - Plot the pressure coefficient distribution along the chord.
     - Visualize streamlines around the airfoil to reveal the flow pattern.
   - **Task 5-b:** Generate annotations or a dynamic plot showing how varying the angle of attack changes the aerodynamic performance.
