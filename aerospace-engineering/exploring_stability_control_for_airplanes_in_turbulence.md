## üåç Scenario

Aircraft stability in turbulence is critical for passenger comfort and operational safety. Sudden gusts or turbulence disrupt the flight path and impose forces on the airplane, requiring robust control mechanisms to restore stability. In this challenge, you'll simulate the effects of turbulence on an airplane's dynamics, analyze its stability control system, and experiment with modifications to enhance performance. This problem connects theory from flight dynamics to practical programming and real-world applications.
