# 🛠️ Smooth Skies: Exploring Stability Control for Airplanes in Turbulence

---

## 📋 Overview
Maintaining stability during turbulence is crucial for aircraft safety. Pilots and autopilot systems constantly adjust control surfaces to counteract destabilizing forces. In this challenge, you will develop a model to simulate airplane stability under turbulent conditions, using control theory to implement feedback mechanisms that stabilize flight.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are an aerospace engineer tasked with designing a stability control system for a commercial jet. Your job is to model the aircraft’s dynamic response when hit by a sudden gust of wind and develop a control system to maintain level flight. By simulating stability under varying turbulence intensities, you can identify optimal control strategies and enhance passenger safety.

The challenge? Turbulence can vary in intensity and direction, requiring adaptive feedback to maintain stability.
