# 🚀 To Infinity and Beyond: Modeling Trajectories for Spaceflight Missions

---

## 📋 Overview
Planning space missions requires precise calculations to ensure that spacecraft follow optimal trajectories while conserving fuel and time. In this challenge, you will model the trajectories of space vehicles from Earth to various destinations (like the Moon, Mars, or even deep space). You’ll calculate orbital transfers, gravity assists, and trajectory corrections to make the mission as efficient as possible.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you’re a mission planner at a space agency, tasked with designing the trajectory for a spacecraft traveling to Mars. You need to calculate the optimal launch window, trajectory path, and mid-course corrections while considering gravitational influences from other celestial bodies. 

The challenge? Balancing fuel efficiency with mission duration while accounting for gravitational perturbations from planetary bodies along the way.
