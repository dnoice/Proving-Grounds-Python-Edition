## üìù Problem Title

**Modeling Trajectories for Spaceflight Missions: An Orbital Mechanics Challenge**

*Instructions:*  
Develop a Python-based simulation that models the spacecraft's trajectory. The goal is to compute orbital transfers, trajectory corrections, and mission parameters using numerical integration and fundamental orbital mechanics principles.

## üåç Scenario

Plan a mission where a spacecraft transitions from one orbit to another‚Äîsuch as moving from a low Earth orbit to a geosynchronous orbit‚Äîor travels to another celestial body. This challenge requires modeling the spacecraft‚Äôs motion under Earth's gravitational pull (and optionally other bodies), incorporating thrust maneuvers and orbital changes. Participants will explore concepts like Hohmann transfers, delta-v budgeting, and reaction to in-orbit maneuvers to understand the trade-offs between fuel consumption, travel time, and orbital precision.

   - **Task 2-c:** Incorporate thrust maneuvers as discrete impulses or continuous forces where necessary.

3. **Trajectory Maneuvers and Optimization**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Model orbital maneuvers like Hohmann transfers, bi-elliptic transfers, or gravity assist trajectories.  
   - **Task 3-b:** Calculate key mission parameters such as delta-v, time of flight, and fuel consumption.

4. **Visualization and Analysis**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Generate 2D and 3D visualizations of the spacecraft's trajectory using libraries such as Matplotlib or Plotly.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Annotate key events in the trajectory, such as burn maneuvers and orbital insertions, and analyze the overall mission performance.
