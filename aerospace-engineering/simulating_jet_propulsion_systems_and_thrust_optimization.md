## üåç Scenario

Jet propulsion systems are fundamental to modern aerospace engineering. In this challenge, the objective is to simulate the internal workings of a jet engine‚Äîmodeling processes from fuel combustion to exhaust expulsion. By applying principles such as conservation of momentum and energy, the simulation will approximate the thrust generated by the engine using equations like:

  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉThrust = ·πÅ ¬∑ (v‚Çë - v‚ÇÄ) + (P‚Çë - P‚Çê) ¬∑ A‚Çë

  
where:  
- ·πÅ is the mass flow rate,
- v‚Çë is the exhaust velocity,
- v‚ÇÄ is the incoming airflow velocity,
- P‚Çë and P‚Çê are the exhaust and ambient pressures, respectively,
- A‚Çë is the nozzle exit area.

Participants will explore how varying engine parameters and operating conditions impact overall thrust, offering insights into performance optimization under different flight scenarios.
