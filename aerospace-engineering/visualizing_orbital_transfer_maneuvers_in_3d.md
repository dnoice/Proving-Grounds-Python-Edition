## üìù Problem Title

**Visualizing Orbital Transfer Maneuvers in 3D: A Dynamic Simulation Challenge**

*Instructions:*  
Develop a Python-based simulation that models and visualizes orbital transfer maneuvers. The goal is to simulate the orbital dynamics between a starting orbit and a target orbit, calculate the required transfer parameters (e.g., delta-v, transfer time), and present these trajectories in an engaging 3D visualization.

## üåç Scenario

Many space missions involve transferring a spacecraft from one orbit to another with minimal fuel usage. A common maneuver is the Hohmann transfer, where a spacecraft undertakes a two-burn maneuver to move between orbits. In this challenge, you will simulate such transfers by modeling the gravitational dynamics, calculating the optimal trajectory, and visualizing the initial orbit, transfer orbit, and final orbit in 3D. This problem combines orbital mechanics theory with computational modeling and interactive visualization.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Defining Orbital Parameters and Initial Conditions**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Specify the initial orbit parameters (e.g., altitude, eccentricity, inclination) for the starting orbit.  
   - **Task 1-b:** Define the target orbit parameters and determine the transfer orbit characteristics.

2. **Modeling Orbital Dynamics and Transfer Maneuvers**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Implement the equations of motion for a spacecraft under a central gravitational force to simulate orbital trajectories.  
   - **Task 2-b:** Model the orbital transfer maneuver (e.g., Hohmann transfer) by calculating the required delta-v and the trajectory of the transfer orbit.

3. **3D Visualization of Orbital Trajectories**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Generate 3D visualizations for the initial orbit, transfer orbit, and final orbit using libraries such as Matplotlib‚Äôs `mplot3d` or Plotly.  
   - **Task 3-b:** Annotate key points along the trajectory, such as the periapsis, apoapsis, and engine burn points.  
   - **Task 3-c:** *(Optional)* Create interactive visualizations allowing real-time adjustment of transfer parameters.

4. **Analysis and Reporting**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Compare computed orbital metrics (e.g., delta-v, transfer time) with theoretical predictions.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Document how different orbital configurations affect the efficiency and feasibility of the transfer maneuver.
