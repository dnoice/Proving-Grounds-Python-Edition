## 📋 Overview
Orbital transfer maneuvers are crucial for efficient space travel, enabling spacecraft to move between orbits while conserving fuel. In this challenge, you will create a dynamic, interactive 3D visualization of various orbital transfer maneuvers, including Hohmann transfers, bi-elliptic transfers, and gravity assists. This problem combines orbital mechanics with real-time visualization to simulate how spacecraft move between celestial bodies.

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re an aerospace engineer at a space exploration agency, tasked with planning a mission to transfer a spacecraft from low Earth orbit (LEO) to a geostationary orbit (GEO). Your goal is to visualize the transfer maneuver and analyze how different methods (Hohmann, bi-elliptic, gravity assist) affect fuel consumption and travel time. 

The challenge? Maneuver efficiency depends on orbital parameters, gravitational influences, and optimal transfer windows. You must build a simulation that adapts to various mission scenarios and visualizes the entire trajectory in 3D.
