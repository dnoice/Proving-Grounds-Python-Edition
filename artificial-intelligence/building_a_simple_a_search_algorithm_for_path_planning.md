# 🛠️ Finding the Optimal Path: Building a Simple A* Search Algorithm for Path Planning

---

## 📋 Overview
Path planning is a fundamental problem in robotics and AI, where the goal is to find the most efficient route between two points. The A* (A-star) algorithm combines the advantages of Dijkstra’s algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search, making it both fast and efficient. In this challenge, you’ll implement a basic A* algorithm to navigate through a grid, avoiding obstacles while finding the shortest path.

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re programming a robot to navigate a warehouse filled with obstacles. The robot needs to find the shortest path from its starting point to a designated goal while avoiding shelves and walls. Your job is to implement the A* algorithm to ensure the robot takes the optimal route. 

The challenge? The environment is dynamic, and obstacles may appear mid-route, requiring adaptive pathfinding.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Setting Up the Environment
Lay the groundwork for the path planning simulation.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🧠 Create a grid or map with designated start and goal points.
- 🔧 Mark obstacles within the grid to represent impassable areas.
- 🌐 Use **NumPy** to efficiently manage the grid data.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A structured grid with start, goal, and obstacle positions clearly marked.

### 🔬 Task 2: Implementing the A* Algorithm
Code the core logic to find the optimal path.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 📌 Implement the heuristic function (e.g., Manhattan distance).
- 💡 Integrate priority queues (using **heapq**) to manage path costs efficiently.
- 🔄 Explore neighboring nodes and calculate the cost (f = g + h).
- 🌱 Reconstruct the path once the goal is reached.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A functional A* algorithm that calculates the shortest path between start and goal.

---

### 🔧 Task 3: Visualizing the Path
Make the solution visually engaging and clear.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌐 Use **Matplotlib** to plot the grid, obstacles, and the calculated path.
- 🎨 Highlight the start, goal, and path nodes for better visualization.
- 🔄 Update the plot dynamically as the path is found.

**Expected Outcome:**
- An animated visualization showing the robot’s progress through the grid.

---

### 🖊️ Task 4: Adapting to Dynamic Obstacles
Make the algorithm robust to changes in the environment.

**Sub-tasks:**
- ⚡ Allow obstacles to appear or disappear randomly during execution.
- 🔁 Implement dynamic re-planning if a new obstacle blocks the path.
- 📊 Measure the efficiency of the dynamic path adjustment.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A responsive pathfinding system that adapts to real-time changes.
