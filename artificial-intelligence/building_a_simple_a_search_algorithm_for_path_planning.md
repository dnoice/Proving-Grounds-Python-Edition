## üìù Problem Title

**Building a Simple A* Search Algorithm for Path Planning: A Heuristic Search Challenge**

*Instructions:*  
Develop a Python-based implementation of the A* search algorithm. The program should create a grid-based environment with obstacles, compute the shortest path from a specified start point to a goal point using a heuristic (such as Manhattan distance), and visualize the process and outcome.

## üåç Scenario

Imagine a robot navigating through a maze-like environment. The space is represented as a 2D grid where each cell is either traversable or blocked by an obstacle. The challenge is to compute the most efficient path from the start to the goal position. This task is fundamental in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and game development, making it an excellent exercise for understanding heuristic search algorithms.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Environment Setup**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Define a grid map using a 2D array where cells represent free space or obstacles.  
   - **Task 1-b:** Specify the start and goal positions on the grid.  
   - **Task 1-c:** Optionally include variable traversal costs for different terrain types.

2. **A\* Algorithm Implementation**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Implement the A* search algorithm:
     - Maintain an open list (priority queue) for nodes to be evaluated.
     - Maintain a closed list for nodes already evaluated.
     - For each node, compute the total cost \( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \), where:
       - \( g(n) \) is the cost from the start node to the current node.
       - \( h(n) \) is the heuristic cost (e.g., Manhattan distance) from the current node to the goal.
   - **Task 2-b:** Update each node‚Äôs cost and maintain the optimal path through parent pointers.
   - **Task 2-c:** Ensure the algorithm terminates when the goal is reached or when no path is available.

3. **Visualization and Analysis**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Visualize the grid map showing obstacles, the explored nodes (e.g., through color coding), and the final optimal path.  
   - **Task 3-b:** Use libraries such as Matplotlib or Plotly to create static or interactive visualizations.  
   - **Task 3-c:** Analyze the performance by recording metrics such as the number of nodes evaluated and the path cost.

4. **Testing and Documentation**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Test the algorithm on multiple grid configurations, including edge cases where no valid path exists.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Document the code with detailed comments explaining the logic behind each major step in the algorithm.  
   - **Task 4-c:** Summarize the algorithm‚Äôs performance and discuss potential improvements or variations (e.g., different heuristic functions).
