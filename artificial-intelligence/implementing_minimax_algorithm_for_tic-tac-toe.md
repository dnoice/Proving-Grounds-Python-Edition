# 🛠️ The Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Master: Implementing Minimax Algorithm (Advanced Version)

---

## 📋 Overview
Tic-Tac-Toe might sound like a simple game, but when it comes to building an unbeatable AI, things get serious. The Minimax algorithm is a classic way to make optimal decisions in adversarial games. In this challenge, you’ll develop a Python-based AI that never loses, analyzing every possible move and predicting the opponent’s best counter.

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re tasked with creating an AI for a competitive Tic-Tac-Toe tournament. Your goal is to build a perfect-playing AI that never loses, regardless of the opponent's strategy. The AI should not only play optimally but also adapt to unconventional moves, identifying weak spots and countering them efficiently.

The challenge? Optimizing the algorithm to make moves within a reasonable time frame, even when faced with complex scenarios.
