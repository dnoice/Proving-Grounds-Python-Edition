# Implementing Minimax Algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe (Advanced Version)

This challenge involves designing and implementing an advanced version of the minimax algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe. Participants will build an AI agent that not only utilizes the classic minimax strategy but also incorporates optimizations such as alpha-beta pruning, heuristic evaluation, and iterative deepening to improve performance and decision-making.

## üìù Problem Title

**Implementing Minimax Algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe (Advanced Version): An AI Game-Playing Challenge**

*Instructions:*  
Develop a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where one or both players are controlled by an AI agent using an advanced minimax algorithm. The algorithm should be optimized with techniques like alpha-beta pruning to reduce the search space, use heuristic evaluations for non-terminal states when full search is computationally expensive, and optionally employ iterative deepening to manage search depth dynamically. Ensure the AI makes optimal moves in both offensive and defensive scenarios while keeping computation efficient.

## üåç Scenario

In many classic board games, such as Tic-Tac-Toe, choosing the right strategy can be solved perfectly using game tree search algorithms. However, even for simple games, enhancements to the basic minimax algorithm (such as alpha-beta pruning) can drastically improve performance by eliminating unnecessary computations. This challenge tasks you with not only implementing the fundamental minimax strategy but also extending it with advanced optimization techniques. The result should be an AI that is both strong and efficient, capable of handling real-time play with minimal lag.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Board Representation and Game Mechanics**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Create a comprehensive representation of the Tic-Tac-Toe board (e.g., using a 2D list or a single array), including functions for:
     - Checking valid moves.
     - Determining win, loss, or draw conditions.
     - Displaying the board state.
   - **Task 1-b:** Define the game rules and manage turn-based player moves (human or AI).

2. **Basic Minimax Algorithm Implementation**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Implement the recursive minimax algorithm to evaluate all possible game states up to terminal outcomes.
   - **Task 2-b:** Ensure the algorithm correctly considers both maximizing (AI) and minimizing (opponent) moves.
   - **Task 2-c:** Validate the basic minimax output against known optimal strategies in Tic-Tac-Toe.

3. **Advanced Optimization Techniques**  
   - **Task 3-a:** **Alpha-Beta Pruning:**  
     - Extend your minimax implementation to include alpha-beta pruning to cut off branches that will not affect the final decision.
     - Compare performance (e.g., number of nodes evaluated) between the basic and pruned versions.
   - **Task 3-b:** **Heuristic Evaluation Function:**  
     - Develop a heuristic function to evaluate board states in non-terminal positions. This is particularly useful if you decide to limit search depth.
     - Incorporate factors such as potential winning moves, blocking opponent moves, and board control.
   - **Task 3-c:** **Iterative Deepening:**  
     - Optionally implement iterative deepening to allow the algorithm to search at increasing depths within a given time constraint.
     - Ensure that the best move discovered within a shorter search depth is used when computation time is limited.

4. **Integration, Testing, and Analysis**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Build an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows a human player to compete against the AI.
   - **Task 4-b:** Document experiments comparing performance metrics (e.g., search depth, computation time, and nodes evaluated) of basic minimax versus the advanced version.
   - **Task 4-c:** Analyze different scenarios (offensive versus defensive) to verify that the AI consistently selects optimal moves.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**  
   - **Task 5-a:** Write clear documentation and code comments explaining the logic behind your minimax implementation and the incorporated optimizations.
   - **Task 5-b:** Prepare a brief report summarizing design choices, optimization benefits, performance metrics, and potential further improvements.

## üéÅ Bonus Section (Advanced Challenge Enhancements)

1. **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment:**  
   - Implement a mechanism that adjusts the search depth or evaluation strategy based on the game's state (e.g., deeper searches in complex scenarios, shallower searches when near terminal states).

2. **Learning and Adaptation:**  
   - Integrate a basic learning module (e.g., reinforcement learning techniques) to fine-tune the heuristic evaluation based on game outcomes.
   
3. **GUI Integration:**  
   - Develop a graphical user interface (using frameworks such as Tkinter, PyQt, or Pygame) that enhances interactive play and visualization of the AI‚Äôs thought process (such as highlighting considered moves).

*Bonus Deliverables:*  
- A comparative study between the standard advanced implementation and the dynamically adjusted version.
- An interactive GUI that demonstrates enhanced control and visualization features for the minimax algorithm.
