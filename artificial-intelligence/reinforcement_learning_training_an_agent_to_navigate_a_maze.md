# Reinforcement Learning: Training an Agent to Navigate a Maze

This challenge involves designing and training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to navigate a maze environment. Participants will build an RL framework‚Äîusing methods such as Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN)‚Äîto enable an agent to learn optimal navigation strategies through trial and error while maximizing cumulative rewards.

## üìù Problem Title

**Reinforcement Learning: Training an Agent to Navigate a Maze ‚Äì An RL Challenge**

*Instructions:*  
Develop a Python-based solution that leverages reinforcement learning techniques to enable an agent to navigate a maze. Your goal is to create a simulation environment representing the maze, implement an RL algorithm that learns from interactions with the environment, and analyze the agent's performance through training and evaluation.

## üåç Scenario

Consider a maze represented as a grid where each cell is either free space or contains an obstacle. The agent starts at a designated starting position and must reach a target destination while avoiding obstacles. The agent receives rewards for progressive moves toward the goal and penalties for hitting walls or moving away from the target. This challenge simulates real-world tasks such as robotic navigation and autonomous path planning, where learning optimal policies in uncertain environments is crucial.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Environment Setup**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Create a maze environment represented as a 2D grid. Define the maze dimensions, start and goal positions, and obstacles.  
   - **Task 1-b:** Implement functions for:
     - State representation (e.g., agent's position).
     - Valid actions (e.g., up, down, left, right).
     - Transition dynamics and reward assignment based on the agent's moves.

2. **Reinforcement Learning Agent Implementation**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Choose an RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning for a tabular approach or Deep Q-Network for discrete state spaces) and set up the agent‚Äôs learning framework.  
   - **Task 2-b:** Define the state-action space, initialize parameters (Q-table or network weights), and implement the update rules based on the agent‚Äôs experiences.  
   - **Task 2-c:** Incorporate an exploration strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy) to balance exploration and exploitation during learning.

3. **Training the Agent**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Design the training loop that runs for a specified number of episodes.  
   - **Task 3-b:** In each episode, allow the agent to interact with the environment, update its Q-values or network weights, and record metrics such as cumulative rewards and episode lengths.  
   - **Task 3-c:** Monitor convergence of the agent‚Äôs policy and adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, epsilon decay) as needed.

4. **Evaluation and Visualization**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Generate plots displaying training metrics, such as average reward per episode and number of steps taken over episodes.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Visualize the final policy by rendering the maze with arrows indicating the optimal action from each state.  
   - **Task 4-c:** Optionally create an animation or interactive demo showing the agent navigating the maze using its learned policy.

5. **Documentation and Analysis**  
   - **Task 5-a:** Document the overall methodology, including environment setup, RL algorithm design, training process, and evaluation metrics.  
   - **Task 5-b:** Discuss the impact of different hyperparameters and any challenges faced during training.  
   - **Task 5-c:** Suggest extensions or improvements, such as implementing more complex maze layouts or incorporating function approximation techniques.
