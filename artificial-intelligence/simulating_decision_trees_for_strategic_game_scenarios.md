# Simulating Decision Trees for Strategic Game Scenarios

This challenge focuses on designing a simulation that builds and evaluates decision trees to analyze strategic game scenarios. Participants will create a framework to represent game states as tree nodes, evaluate outcomes using heuristic scoring, and visualize the decision-making process.

## üìù Problem Title

**Simulating Decision Trees for Strategic Game Scenarios: A Strategic Decision-Making Challenge**

*Instructions:*  
Develop a Python-based simulation that constructs decision trees for strategic game scenarios. Your solution should model game states as nodes in a tree, evaluate potential outcomes using heuristics, and determine the optimal decision path. Additionally, include visualizations that help interpret the structure of the decision tree and highlight key decision points.

## üåç Scenario

In many strategic games‚Äîfrom board games to real-time strategy video games‚Äîplayers must evaluate several possible moves before selecting the optimal action. This challenge simulates such scenarios by modeling the decision process using trees. Each node represents a game state after a decision, and branches capture the resulting possibilities. By assigning scores (or rewards) to these states using heuristic evaluations, the simulation helps identify the path that maximizes the chances of success or minimizes potential losses. Such techniques are fundamental in game theory, AI for games, and decision support systems.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Game State Representation and Environment Setup**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Define a simplified strategic game scenario (e.g., a turn-based board game or a decision-making puzzle).  
   - **Task 1-b:** Design a representation for game states (e.g., using objects or nested data structures) and define the set of possible actions from each state.

2. **Decision Tree Construction**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Implement a function that generates a decision tree by recursively simulating available moves from the current game state up to a specified depth.  
   - **Task 2-b:** Ensure that each node contains information about the game state, the action taken, and a placeholder for the evaluation score.

3. **Heuristic Evaluation and Outcome Analysis**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Develop a heuristic function that scores non-terminal game states based on strategic criteria (e.g., potential rewards, positional advantage, risk of loss).  
   - **Task 3-b:** Propagate scores from terminal nodes back up the tree to evaluate the best sequence of moves.

4. **Optimal Decision Determination**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Implement an algorithm that traverses the decision tree (or its pruned version) to select the optimal path, considering both maximizing rewards and minimizing risks.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Compare the outcomes of different evaluation strategies (e.g., aggressive versus defensive heuristics).

5. **Visualization and Analysis**  
   - **Task 5-a:** Create visualizations of the decision tree using libraries such as Graphviz, NetworkX, or Plotly, with annotations for node scores and chosen actions.  
   - **Task 5-b:** Generate reports or graphs that illustrate how varying the depth of the tree or the heuristic parameters impacts the decision choices.

6. **Documentation and Reporting**  
   - **Task 6-a:** Document your code and design decisions thoroughly, explaining the methodology for tree construction, heuristic scoring, and decision selection.  
   - **Task 6-b:** Summarize your findings and discuss potential improvements or extensions (e.g., integrating pruning techniques or dynamic state evaluation).

## üì¶ Deliverables

- **üíª Code Implementation:**  
  - A Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the full simulation code with clear comments and detailed documentation.
  
- **üìä Analysis Report:**  
  - A report summarizing the approach, including the design of game state representations, decision tree structure, heuristic evaluations, and comparisons between different strategies.
  
- **üñºÔ∏è Visualizations:**  
  - Graphical representations of the decision tree structure with annotated node scores and decision paths.
  - *(Optional)* An interactive dashboard that allows real-time adjustments of heuristic parameters and tree depth.

## üéÅ Bonus Section (Advanced Challenge)

1. **Pruning Techniques:**  
   - Implement pruning methods (e.g., alpha-beta pruning) to reduce the size of the decision tree and improve computation efficiency.
   
2. **Dynamic Scenario Adaptation:**  
   - Extend the simulation to handle dynamic game scenarios where the state space changes over time or includes stochastic elements.
   
3. **Multi-Agent Decision Trees:**  
   - Incorporate multi-agent interactions where decisions from multiple players are simulated concurrently, and analyze the emergent strategies.

*Bonus Deliverables:*  
- A comparative analysis between the basic decision tree simulation and the pruned or dynamic version.
- An interactive tool or GUI that demonstrates how different strategies affect the decision outcomes in real time.
