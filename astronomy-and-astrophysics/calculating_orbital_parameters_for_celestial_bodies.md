# 🌌 Calculating Orbital Parameters for Celestial Bodies

---

## 📋 Overview
Space – the final frontier! When it comes to understanding the motion of celestial bodies, it’s all about getting the orbital parameters right. Whether it’s planets, moons, asteroids, or that random space junk zooming by, calculating orbits helps scientists predict where they’ll be and how they’ll move. 

In this challenge, you’re going to build a Python-powered system to calculate the **orbital elements** of celestial objects. Think of it as crunching the numbers to figure out how cosmic billiards work.

## 🌍 Scenario
You just joined a research team that’s got a fresh dataset from a newly discovered exoplanet orbiting a distant star. They need your skills to figure out the planet’s **orbital parameters** – like how far it orbits, how long it takes to complete one lap, and just how weird (or not) its orbit shape is. 

But here’s the kicker – space data is messy, and small changes can throw your calculations out of whack. Your mission is to extract reliable orbital data from this chaotic mix and make sense of it.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
First things first – get your data in order!

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🪐 Generate or import positional data for the celestial body (like distance from the star and angular position). 
- 📅 Format it nicely into a time-series for easy analysis.
- 📈 Plot the raw data to get a feel for how this orbit is shaping up.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A neat and organized dataset of the celestial body’s position over time.

### 🔬 Task 2: Crunching the Orbital Numbers
Now it’s time to make sense of that data and calculate the orbital parameters.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌠 Use Kepler’s laws and Newton’s gravitation to find the semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, and orbital period.
- 🧮 Make sure to cross-check your results with known constants (like Earth's orbit) to see if your calculations are on point.
- 📑 Document your method so anyone can follow your logic.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A Python script that spits out the celestial body’s orbital parameters like a cosmic fortune teller.

### 🔧 Task 3: Visualize the Orbit
Seeing is believing – let’s map that orbit!

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌌 Plot the orbital path based on your calculated parameters.
- 🔄 Create an animated simulation to see how the body moves around its star.
- 📊 Compare the simulation to the real observational data – see if they line up.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A sweet visual that shows the calculated orbit and compares it to actual data.

---

### 🖊️ Task 4: Sensitivity Check
Orbits can get pretty wacky if you mess with the numbers. Let’s see how sensitive your calculations are.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🔍 Tweak initial conditions (like position or velocity) and see how the orbit changes.
- 🌗 Plot different orbits based on slight data variations.
- 📝 Summarize your findings on how small changes affect the orbit shape or size.

**Expected Outcome:**
- An analysis report showing how stable (or unstable) your calculated orbit is when you nudge the inputs.
