**Calculating Orbital Parameters for Celestial Bodies: A Celestial Mechanics Challenge**

*Instructions:*  
Develop a Python-based simulation and analysis that calculates the orbital parameters of a celestial object given input data such as its position and velocity vectors, or information about its orbit. Use analytical methods based on Kepler‚Äôs laws and Newtonian gravity to derive parameters like semi-major axis, eccentricity, orbital period, periapsis, and apoapsis. Document your methodology and compare the computed results with expected theoretical values (or known data for real celestial bodies).

## üåç Scenario

Celestial mechanics is fundamental to understanding the motion of bodies in space‚Äîfrom satellites orbiting the Earth to planets revolving around the Sun. In this challenge, you are tasked with computing orbital parameters given specific orbital data. For instance, using the vis-viva equation and conservation of angular momentum, you will determine the characteristics of an elliptical orbit. This problem bridges theoretical physics and practical computation, offering insights into orbital dynamics and system modeling.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Defining the System and Input Parameters**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Choose a celestial object or satellite and define the input parameters (e.g., initial position vector, velocity vector, or known orbital points such as periapsis and apoapsis).  
   - **Task 1-b:** Specify the physical constants required, including the gravitational parameter \( \mu = GM \) (for example, for Earth, \( \mu \approx 3.986 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^2 \)).

2. **Deriving the Orbital Parameters**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Implement the vis-viva equation:  
     \[
     v^2 = \mu \left(\frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a}\right)
     \]
     to solve for the semi-major axis \( a \).  
   - **Task 2-b:** Calculate the orbit eccentricity \( e \) using the relationship between the specific angular momentum, energy, and orbital parameters.  
   - **Task 2-c:** Compute the orbital period \( T \) using Kepler's third law:  
     \[
     T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{a^3}{\mu}}
     \]
   - **Task 2-d:** Determine the distances at periapsis and apoapsis:  
     \[
     r_{\text{per}} = a(1 - e) \quad \text{and} \quad r_{\text{apo}} = a(1 + e)
     \]

3. **Numerical Implementation and Validation**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Develop a Python script or Jupyter Notebook that performs the calculations for one or more scenarios.  
   - **Task 3-b:** Validate your model by comparing the computed parameters with known values for a specific celestial body or satellite.  
   - **Task 3-c:** Include plots or tables that summarize how variations in the input parameters (e.g., different initial velocities) affect the orbital characteristics.

4. **Visualization and Analysis**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Visualize the computed elliptical orbit in 2D or 3D space. Libraries such as Matplotlib or Plotly can be used to plot the orbit along with marked positions for periapsis and apoapsis.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Analyze the sensitivity of the orbital parameters with respect to changes in the input parameters. Provide commentary or a short discussion on the stability and behavior of orbits under small perturbations.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**  
   - **Task 5-a:** Document your methodology thoroughly with inline comments and a detailed explanation of the equations used.  
   - **Task 5-b:** Prepare a report summarizing the simulation results, theoretical background, and any discrepancies between computed and expected values.  
   - **Task 5-c:** Discuss potential extensions (e.g., incorporating non-Keplerian effects such as atmospheric drag or third-body perturbations).
