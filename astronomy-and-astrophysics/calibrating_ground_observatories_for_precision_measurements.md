# 🌍🔭 Earth-Based Astrometry: Calibrating Ground Observatories for Precision Measurements

---

## 📋 Overview
When it comes to stargazing with high-powered telescopes, precision is the name of the game. Whether you're tracking asteroids, pinpointing exoplanets, or just getting that stellar alignment just right, ground-based observatories face a ton of challenges. 

From **atmospheric distortion** to **telescope misalignment**, even the slightest error can throw off your measurements by light-years. In this challenge, you'll develop a Python script to simulate and correct observational errors, ensuring your telescope stays sharp and your data stays accurate.

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re part of a team working at a ground-based observatory that just noticed its latest stellar position measurements are slightly off. Something’s messing with the telescope’s precision, and you’ve got a hunch it’s a mix of **atmospheric distortion**, **instrumental drift**, and **alignment issues**. 

Your mission? Analyze the data, identify the calibration errors, and fine-tune the settings to bring the measurements back in line.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Data Acquisition and Simulation
Start by simulating the type of data you’d get from a ground-based telescope.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌌 Generate a dataset of **stellar positions** (RA/Dec) based on a known star catalog.  
- 🌫️ Introduce **simulated errors** for atmospheric distortion and telescope misalignment.  
- 📊 Plot the **raw data** to visualize the distortions.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A synthetic dataset representing **imprecise telescope measurements**.

### 🔬 Task 2: Error Analysis and Identification
Time to diagnose what’s throwing your data off. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🧮 Calculate the **difference between observed and true positions**.  
- 🌐 Use statistical methods (like **least squares**) to quantify the **degree of error**.  
- 🔍 Identify patterns that indicate **specific calibration issues** (e.g., constant drift = misalignment).  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A report identifying **primary error sources** with visual plots showing the data discrepancies.

### 🔧 Task 3: Calibration and Correction
Let’s bring that data back to reality. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🔄 Apply **correction algorithms** to counteract known errors.  
- 🌠 Adjust the data to account for **atmospheric refraction** and **instrumental drift**.  
- 📝 Validate the corrected data by comparing it to the **original star catalog**.  

**Expected Outcome:**
