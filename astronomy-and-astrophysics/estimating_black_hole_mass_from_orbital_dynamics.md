# 🌌 Gravitational Dynamics: Estimating Black Hole Mass from Orbital Dynamics
---

## 📋 Overview
Black holes are some of the most enigmatic and powerful objects in the universe. They bend space, time, and anything that dares to get too close. One of the wildest things about black holes is that we can estimate their mass just by watching how they mess with nearby stars or gas clouds. 

In this challenge, you’ll use Python to estimate the mass of a black hole based on the **orbital motion of a nearby object**. It’s like being a cosmic detective, tracking how gravity warps space to figure out just how massive that black hole really is.

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re an astrophysicist working at an observatory, and your team has spotted a star moving in a tight orbit around what appears to be a black hole. You’ve got some raw data on the star’s orbital speed and distance from the black hole, but now you need to calculate the black hole’s mass. 

The mission? Use **orbital dynamics and gravitational equations** to reveal the true heft of this invisible behemoth.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Analyzing Observational Data
Get the data prepped and ready for analysis.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 📥 Import or simulate data on the star’s orbital velocity and distance from the black hole.
- 🗃️ Store the data in a structured format (like CSV or a DataFrame).
- 📈 Plot the star’s velocity vs. distance to visualize the orbital relationship.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A clean dataset and an initial plot to visualize the star’s motion.

### 🔬 Task 2: Calculating the Black Hole Mass
It’s time to crunch the numbers and estimate that mass.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌟 Use the formula derived from **Kepler’s third law** and **Newton’s law of gravitation**:
  
\[
  M = \frac{v^2 \cdot r}{G}
\]
  
  Where:
  - M = Mass of the black hole  
  - v = Orbital velocity of the star  
  - r = Distance between the star and black hole  
  - G = Gravitational constant  

- 🧮 Implement the formula in Python to calculate the mass.
- 📝 Validate your result by comparing it with known black hole masses (like the one at the center of the Milky Way).

**Expected Outcome:**
- A Python script that outputs the estimated mass of the black hole.

### 🔧 Task 3: Estimating Uncertainty
Mass calculations in astronomy are never perfect – let’s figure out the margin of error.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 📊 Perform error propagation to estimate the uncertainty in your mass calculation.
- 🔄 Vary the input parameters slightly to see how sensitive the mass estimate is.
- 📝 Report the calculated mass with its uncertainty range.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A refined mass estimate with a clear indication of potential errors.

### 🖊️ Task 4: Visualizing the Gravitational Dance
Let’s make this calculation come to life with some visuals.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌌 Plot the orbit of the star around the black hole.
- 💫 Create a dynamic visualization that shows how the star’s speed changes as it orbits.
- 🪐 Overlay the calculated mass and uncertainty on the plot.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A visually appealing and informative graph showing the orbital path and estimated mass.
