## üåç Scenario

Black holes are the enigmatic giants of the universe, whose immense gravitational pull can govern the motion of nearby celestial objects. Scientists often estimate the mass of black holes by observing the orbital dynamics of stars around them. By applying fundamental laws of motion and gravitation, you‚Äôll compute the mass of a hypothetical black hole based on the orbital properties of a nearby star. This simulation brings astrophysics straight to your keyboard!
