# 🌌 Dark Matter Dynamics: Modeling the Effects of Dark Matter on Galactic Rotation

---

## 📋 Overview
Dark matter – it’s the cosmic wild card that makes up most of the universe's mass, yet we can’t see it or directly detect it. We only know it’s there because galaxies don’t spin the way they should based on visible matter alone. It’s like finding invisible weights in a spinning merry-go-round – you can’t see them, but you know they’re there because the ride is moving way too fast. 

In this challenge, you’ll model how dark matter influences the **rotation curves of galaxies**. By analyzing the difference between the **expected rotational velocity** (based on visible mass) and the **observed velocity**, you’ll estimate the **distribution of dark matter** in a galaxy.

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re an astrophysicist at a cutting-edge research center, working to understand why galaxies don’t spin the way physics says they should. You’ve got some data on the rotational velocities of a distant galaxy, but the math doesn’t add up if you only consider visible stars and gas. Your mission? Develop a model that incorporates **dark matter distribution** to explain the galaxy’s motion.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Analyzing the Rotation Curve Data
First, let’s get a feel for the data and the mystery it holds.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 📥 Import or simulate data on the **rotational velocity** of stars at various distances from the galactic center. 
- 📊 Plot the **observed rotation curve** to visualize how velocity changes with distance. 
- 🔍 Overlay the **theoretical rotation curve** calculated from **visible mass distribution**. 

**Expected Outcome:**
- A plot showing the difference between **observed** and **theoretical** rotation velocities.

### 🔬 Task 2: Estimating the Dark Matter Distribution
Now it’s time to account for that extra gravitational oomph. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌟 Use the discrepancy between the curves to estimate the **mass distribution of dark matter**. 
- 📏 Model the **density profile** of dark matter using a standard model, like the **Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile**:  
\[
  \rho(r) = \frac{\rho_0}{\frac{r}{r_s}(1 + \frac{r}{r_s})^2}
\]
  Where:  
  - \rho_0 = characteristic density  
  - r = radial distance from the center  
  - r_s = scale radius  

- 🔄 Adjust the model parameters to fit the observed data.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A script that estimates the dark matter distribution based on rotational data.

---

### 🔧 Task 3: Modeling the Composite Rotation Curve
Let’s see how adding dark matter changes the rotation story. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🪐 Combine the **visible mass model** and the **dark matter model** to create a **composite rotation curve**.  
- 🌌 Plot the new curve alongside the original data to see if it fits better. 
- 📝 Explain the physical implications of the improved fit. 

**Expected Outcome:**
- A plot showing the **composite rotation curve** and an analysis of how dark matter helps close the gap between theory and observation.

---

### 🖊️ Task 4: Sensitivity Analysis and Exploration
Dark matter models can be tricky – let’s test how sensitive our model is to changes. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🔄 Vary the parameters (\rho_0 and r_s) and observe how the rotation curve shifts. 
- 📈 Plot multiple composite curves to show the impact of different dark matter profiles. 
- 📝 Discuss which parameter combinations make the model fit best. 

**Expected Outcome:**
- An analysis of how sensitive the model is to changes in dark matter distribution assumptions.
