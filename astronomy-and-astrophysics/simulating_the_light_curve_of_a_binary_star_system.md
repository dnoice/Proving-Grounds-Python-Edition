# 💃🌟 Cosmic Tango: Simulating the Light Curve of a Binary Star System

---

## 📋 Overview
Binary stars are like the cosmic **tango dancers** of the universe – two stars locked in a gravitational waltz, circling each other while emitting changing light intensities. As they orbit, the combined brightness we observe from Earth can vary, creating a **light curve**. 

In this challenge, you'll simulate the **light curve** of a binary star system based on their orbits and luminosities. Think of it as capturing the **stellar dance** in Python, where the brightness changes as the stars eclipse or move closer to each other. 

---

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re part of an astrophysics team studying a newly discovered binary star system. Your goal is to model the **light curve** to understand the orbital dynamics and how the brightness changes over time. The data you have includes the stars' **masses, orbital distances, and luminosities**. 

Your mission? Write a Python script to **simulate the light curve** and help astronomers understand the characteristics of this stellar pair.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Setting Up the Binary Star Model
First, we need to create a model for our cosmic duo. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌠 Define the **masses, luminosities, and orbital distances** of the two stars. 
- 🌌 Calculate the **orbital period** using Kepler’s third law:
  
\[
  P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2a^3}{G(M_1 + M_2)}
\]
  
  Where:  
  - P = orbital period  
  - a = semi-major axis (orbital distance)  
  - G = gravitational constant  
  - M_1, M_2 = masses of the stars  

- 🪐 Set up initial conditions for the **orbital positions and velocities**. 

**Expected Outcome:**
- A basic model of the binary star system with calculated orbital parameters.

### 🔬 Task 2: Calculating the Light Curve
Time to figure out how the brightness changes as the stars orbit. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 💡 Calculate the **combined luminosity** at each time step. 
- 🌑 Incorporate **eclipsing events** when one star passes in front of the other, partially blocking the light. 
- 📈 Generate a **light curve plot** showing brightness over time. 

**Expected Outcome:**
- A Python script that outputs the simulated light curve based on the orbital motion. 

---

### 🔧 Task 3: Adding Realism with Orbital Inclination
Orbits aren’t always perfectly face-on, so let’s account for tilt. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌀 Introduce an **inclination angle (i)** to tilt the orbital plane. 
- 🔄 Adjust the brightness calculation to account for the line-of-sight effect. 
- 📝 Plot the **light curve with inclination** to see how it changes the observed brightness. 

**Expected Outcome:**
- An improved light curve that reflects the angle of observation.

### 🖊️ Task 4: Visualizing the Binary System
Make it dynamic – show the stellar waltz! 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌠 Create an **animated plot** showing the binary stars orbiting each other. 
- 💫 Overlay the **light curve** on the animation to see how the brightness changes in real-time. 
- 🪐 Label key events, like eclipses, for added clarity. 

**Expected Outcome:**
- A visually engaging animation of the binary star system and its light curve.
