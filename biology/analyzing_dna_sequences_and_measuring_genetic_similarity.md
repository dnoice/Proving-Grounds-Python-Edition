# 🧬 Genetic Codebreaker: Analyzing DNA Sequences and Measuring Genetic Similarity

---

## 📋 Overview
DNA – the blueprint of life! It’s like nature’s ultimate data storage, containing all the instructions to build and operate living organisms. But when it comes to comparing DNA sequences, things can get tricky – even a tiny difference in base pairs can change everything. 

In this challenge, you’ll develop a Python-based system to analyze DNA sequences and measure their **genetic similarity**. Think of it as creating your own molecular detective tool to see how closely related two samples are. 

---

## 🌍 Scenario
You’ve joined a biotech research team working to analyze genetic data from different organisms. Your current task? Determine how similar the DNA of two samples is – whether it’s comparing human and chimpanzee genomes or analyzing mutations in a virus. Your Python script will help determine genetic relationships by comparing sequences, identifying mutations, and calculating similarity scores.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: DNA Sequence Acquisition and Preprocessing
First, let’s gather our DNA data and get it into a workable format. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🧬 Load or simulate **DNA sequences** from text files or databases.  
- 🗃️ Clean the data by removing any **non-nucleotide characters** or gaps.  
- 📏 Standardize sequence lengths by trimming or padding where necessary.  
- 📊 Print a summary of each sequence (length, GC content, nucleotide frequency).  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A clean, standardized dataset containing the DNA sequences for comparison.

### 🔬 Task 2: Measuring Genetic Similarity
Now, let’s compare the sequences to see how much they match up. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🧩 Implement a function to calculate the **Hamming distance** (number of mismatches between sequences of equal length).  
- 📏 For sequences of different lengths, calculate the **Levenshtein distance** (minimum number of edits to convert one sequence to another).  
- 🧠 Use the **Jaccard similarity coefficient** to compare sets of k-mers (subsequences of length k) between the two sequences.  
- 📈 Generate a **similarity score** based on the combined methods.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A clear numerical score indicating how genetically similar the two DNA sequences are.

### 🔧 Task 3: Visualizing Genetic Similarity
Data visualization time – make it intuitive! 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌐 Plot a **heatmap** to visualize nucleotide matches and mismatches.  
- 📊 Create a **similarity matrix** if comparing multiple sequences at once.  
- 🔄 Display a **phylogenetic tree** (if applicable) to show genetic relationships.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- Graphical representations that clearly show the similarity or divergence between DNA sequences.  

---

### 🖊️ Task 4: Handling Mutations and Variants
DNA can be tricky – let’s see if we can spot specific mutations. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🔄 Identify **SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)** between sequences.  
- 🧬 Detect **insertions, deletions, and substitutions** that might indicate mutations.  
- 📑 Log all identified mutations with their **position, type, and potential impact**.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A detailed report of mutations, including a breakdown of their genetic significance.
