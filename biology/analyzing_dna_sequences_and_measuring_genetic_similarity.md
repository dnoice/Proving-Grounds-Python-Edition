## üìù Problem Title

**Analyzing DNA Sequences and Measuring Genetic Similarity: A Genomics Challenge**

*Here‚Äôs the scoop:*  
Develop a Python-based tool that analyzes DNA sequences to assess genetic similarity. You‚Äôll use sequence alignment algorithms (like Needleman-Wunsch or Smith-Waterman), calculate similarity scores, and visualize the alignment for better insights into genetic relationships.

## üåç Scenario

DNA sequences hold the blueprint of life, and comparing them reveals evolutionary relationships and functional similarities. Whether identifying related organisms or tracing mutations, sequence alignment is a key step in genomics. In this task, you‚Äôll compute pairwise alignments for sample DNA sequences, evaluate genetic similarity, and interpret the alignment results in biological terms.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Import or define sample DNA sequences for analysis. Use nucleotide sequences such as:
     ```
     Sequence 1: AGCTTAGGCTA
     Sequence 2: CGTTAGGCTAA
     ```
   - **Task 1-b:** Preprocess the data to ensure valid inputs (e.g., strip invalid characters, normalize case).

2. **Implement Sequence Alignment**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Choose an alignment algorithm:
     - **Global alignment** (Needleman-Wunsch) for comparing entire sequences.
     - **Local alignment** (Smith-Waterman) for identifying regions of similarity within sequences.
   - **Task 2-b:** Implement the alignment using libraries such as Biopython, or write the algorithm from scratch for deeper learning.  
   - **Task 2-c:** Include scoring parameters (e.g., match, mismatch, and gap penalties).

3. **Calculate Similarity Scores**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Compute the similarity score for the aligned sequences based on matches, mismatches, and gaps.  
   - **Task 3-b:** Interpret the similarity score in terms of percentage or raw numerical values.

4. **Visualization and Insights**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Create a visual representation of the alignment (e.g., using text output or graphical tools). Show aligned sequences and highlight matches and mismatches.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Discuss the biological implications of the similarity score. How closely related are the sequences?

5. **Documentation and Reporting**  
   - **Task 5-a:** Document the methodology with inline comments and detailed explanations of alignment algorithms.  
   - **Task 5-b:** Summarize results in a report that includes the aligned sequences, similarity scores, and biological interpretations.
