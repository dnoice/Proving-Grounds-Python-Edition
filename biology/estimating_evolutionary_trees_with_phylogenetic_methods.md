# Estimating Evolutionary Trees with Phylogenetic Methods

This exploration takes you into the heart of evolutionary biology. You'll analyze genetic sequence data to construct evolutionary trees that reveal the relationships among organisms. Using Python, you'll align sequences, generate distance matrices, and build phylogenetic trees with methods such as Neighbor Joining or Maximum Likelihood.

## üìù Problem Title

**Estimating Evolutionary Trees with Phylogenetic Methods: A Phylogeny Challenge**

*Here's the scoop:*  
Develop a Python-based pipeline that processes sequence data, estimates evolutionary distances, and constructs phylogenetic trees. You'll experiment with different methods to gauge the evolutionary relationships among species, ultimately visualizing your tree to reveal the branching pattern that tells the story of life.

## üåç Scenario

From bacteria to mammals, life has evolved over millions of years, leaving clues in genetic sequences. By comparing these sequences, scientists can infer the evolutionary ties that bind different species. In this challenge, you'll:
- Gather and preprocess genetic data.
- Perform multiple sequence alignments to ensure comparable regions.
- Compute evolutionary distances and construct trees using methods such as Neighbor Joining or Maximum Parsimony.
- Visualize the resultant tree to understand species divergence and phylogenetic clusters.

This hands-on project bridges computational techniques with evolutionary theory, letting you see the tree of life unfold before your eyes.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Gather a set of genetic sequences (DNA, RNA, or protein) in FASTA format.  
   - **Task 1-b:** Preprocess the sequences by cleaning, trimming, and ensuring they are properly aligned using tools such as ClustalW or MAFFT.
  
2. **Multiple Sequence Alignment**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Perform multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to align the sequences and identify conserved regions.  
   - **Task 2-b:** Use available libraries (like Biopython‚Äôs AlignIO) or external tools to generate the alignment.
  
3. **Distance Matrix Calculation**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Compute a distance matrix from the aligned sequences using a suitable metric (e.g., p-distance or a substitution model).  
   - **Task 3-b:** Validate the distance computation by comparing with expected evolutionary divergence if known.
  
4. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Construct a phylogenetic tree using methods such as Neighbor Joining, Maximum Parsimony, or Maximum Likelihood.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Incorporate bootstrapping to assess the reliability of the inferred tree.
  
5. **Visualization and Analysis**  
   - **Task 5-a:** Visualize the phylogenetic tree using libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, or tools such as ETE Toolkit, with proper branch labels and bootstrap values.  
   - **Task 5-b:** Analyze the tree to interpret evolutionary relationships and discuss potential evolutionary scenarios.
  
6. **Documentation and Reporting**  
   - **Task 6-a:** Document your methodology, including the alignment process, distance calculation, and tree-building steps with clear inline comments.  
   - **Task 6-b:** Prepare a report summarizing your findings, challenges faced, and the evolutionary insights gleaned from your tree.
