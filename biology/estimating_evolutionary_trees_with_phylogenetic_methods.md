# 🌱 Evolutionary Tree Mapping: Estimating Evolutionary Trees with Phylogenetic Methods

---

## 📋 Overview
Life on Earth has been evolving for billions of years, and understanding the **relationships between species** is like tracing a massive, ancient family tree. Phylogenetic trees help scientists visualize these relationships, showing how organisms diverged over time. 

In this challenge, you’ll use Python to build **evolutionary trees** based on DNA sequences. It’s like piecing together the **genetic history** of life, one branch at a time. 

---

## 🌍 Scenario
You’ve joined a research project aimed at mapping the **evolutionary relationships** between a set of organisms. Your job is to take **DNA sequence data** and estimate a **phylogenetic tree** that best represents their genetic connections. 

Whether it’s comparing different strains of a virus or mapping the evolutionary distance between animal species, your Python-based tool will reveal who’s more closely related – and who’s been branching off on their own evolutionary journey.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
Let’s gather our genetic clues and prepare them for analysis. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌱 Load or simulate **DNA sequences** for multiple species.  
- 🧬 Clean and align the sequences to ensure they’re comparable.  
- 📊 Generate a **distance matrix** based on pairwise sequence differences.  
- 📝 Print a summary of the data, including sequence length and nucleotide composition.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A well-organized dataset with **aligned DNA sequences** and a calculated **distance matrix**.  

---

### 🔬 Task 2: Building the Phylogenetic Tree
Now, it’s time to construct the tree that maps out genetic relationships. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🪐 Implement a **distance-based method** like **UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean)** or **Neighbor-Joining**.  
- 🧠 Use a **maximum likelihood method** for a more statistically robust tree.  
- 🌳 Construct the **phylogenetic tree** and label the branches with **genetic distances**.  
- 📈 Visualize the tree as a hierarchical diagram.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A **phylogenetic tree** that clearly shows the **genetic relationships** between species.  

---

### 🔧 Task 3: Evaluating Tree Robustness
Not all trees are equally reliable – let’s test how strong our branches are. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🔄 Perform **bootstrap analysis** to evaluate the stability of tree branches.  
- 📏 Recompute the tree with **slightly altered input data** to test consistency.  
- 📊 Plot a **consensus tree** showing the most consistent branching patterns.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- An analysis of the **tree’s robustness**, highlighting the most and least stable relationships.  

---

### 🖊️ Task 4: Visualizing Evolutionary Distance
Let’s make the tree visually intuitive and informative. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌟 Color the branches based on **genetic distance** (e.g., longer branches = more divergence).  
- 📈 Add **bootstrap values** as annotations to indicate branch support.  
- 💡 Create an interactive visualization that lets users explore different tree structures.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A visually appealing and **interactive evolutionary tree** with clear distance indicators.
