# 🧬 Molecular Origami: Protein Folding Simulations in 3D

---

## 📋 Overview
Proteins don’t just float around as long chains – they fold into intricate 3D shapes that determine their function. From enzymes catalyzing reactions to structural proteins forming cellular scaffolds, their shape is everything. But predicting how they fold? That’s like trying to solve a puzzle without knowing the final picture. 

In this challenge, you’ll simulate how a protein folds in three dimensions, driven by forces like **hydrophobic interactions**, **hydrogen bonding**, and **van der Waals forces**. It’s a molecular dance that transforms a simple chain into a functional structure – and you’re about to script it. 

---

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re working in a cutting-edge biotech lab where your team is analyzing how specific proteins fold. The folding process is crucial for understanding diseases caused by **misfolded proteins**, like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s. Your goal is to build a Python simulation that predicts the **3D structure** based on the amino acid sequence, using physics-based modeling to capture the folding process.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Setting Up the Protein Sequence
First, we need to define our protein backbone.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🧬 Input or generate a **protein sequence** using standard amino acid codes (e.g., **'ACDEFGHIK'**).  
- 📏 Validate the sequence to ensure it contains only valid amino acids.  
- 🗃️ Store the sequence in a structured format (like a list or a DataFrame).  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A correctly formatted amino acid sequence ready for simulation.

### 🔬 Task 2: Modeling the Folding Forces
Next, let’s set the rules for how the protein bends and twists.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌐 Define the primary forces involved:  
  - **Hydrophobic interactions:** Nonpolar residues cluster together.  
  - **Hydrogen bonding:** Forms between polar residues.  
  - **van der Waals forces:** Weak attractions between atoms.  
  - **Electrostatic forces:** Charged residues attracting or repelling each other.  

- 🧮 Formulate equations to model these interactions.  
- 🔧 Implement a **force calculation function** to evaluate interactions between residues.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A robust force model that dictates how the protein folds based on interactions.

### 🔧 Task 3: Simulating the Folding Process
Now comes the real magic – making the protein take shape. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌀 Use **Monte Carlo simulations** to explore different folding configurations.  
- 🔄 Implement **energy minimization** to find the most stable structure.  
- 📈 Track the **free energy** as the protein folds.  
- 🗺️ Save intermediate states to visualize the folding trajectory.  

**Expected Outcome:**

### 🖊️ Task 4: Visualizing the Protein in 3D
Time to see our molecular origami in action.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 📊 Use **PyMOL** or **PyVista** to visualize the protein’s structure.  
- 🌟 Color-code regions based on **hydrophobicity**, **bonding**, or **charge**.  
- 🎥 Create an **animated visualization** that shows the folding process step by step.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A dynamic 3D model that visually represents how the protein folds.
