# 🦴 Ancient Genomics: Reconstructing DNA from Fossilized Remains

---

## 📋 Overview
Imagine stumbling upon a fossil that’s been buried for tens of thousands of years. Inside that ancient bone or preserved tissue lies a hidden story – fragments of DNA that once defined a living being. But time has taken its toll, degrading the sequence into a **molecular jigsaw puzzle**. 

Your challenge? Develop a Python script that takes fragmented, degraded DNA sequences and attempts to **reconstruct the original genome**. It’s a bit like putting together a shattered relic – but this one’s written in genetic code. 

---

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re working with a team of paleogeneticists studying ancient hominids. You’ve just received **sequencing data** from a well-preserved Neanderthal fossil. The catch? The DNA is fragmented, filled with errors, and contaminated with modern sequences. 

Your mission is to develop a method to **clean, assemble, and analyze** the ancient DNA to identify its species and possible genetic links to modern humans.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
First, let’s make sense of this messy genetic soup.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 📥 Load simulated **ancient DNA sequences** with fragments of varying lengths and qualities.  
- 🧬 Remove **contaminated modern sequences** using a reference genome.  
- 📝 Filter out **low-quality reads** (e.g., sequences with excessive base errors or gaps).  
- 📊 Print a summary of the cleaned data, including the number of sequences retained.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A cleaned dataset of ancient DNA, free from contamination and noise.

### 🔬 Task 2: Reconstructing the DNA Sequence
Now comes the puzzle-solving – putting the fragments back together.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🧩 Implement an **alignment algorithm** (like Needleman-Wunsch or Smith-Waterman) to piece together overlapping fragments.  
- 🔄 Use **consensus building** to resolve ambiguous regions.  
- 📝 Output a **consensus sequence** representing the reconstructed DNA.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A single, reconstructed DNA sequence assembled from fragments.  

---

### 🔧 Task 3: Phylogenetic Analysis
Let’s see how this ancient sequence stacks up against modern genomes.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌳 Compare the reconstructed sequence with known **human, Neanderthal, and other hominid genomes**.  
- 🧠 Calculate **genetic similarity scores** to estimate the evolutionary relationship.  
- 📈 Visualize the **phylogenetic tree** showing where the ancient DNA fits.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A phylogenetic tree illustrating the relationship between the ancient and modern sequences.  

---

### 🖊️ Task 4: Analyzing Ancestral Markers
Time to dig deeper into the evolutionary clues.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🧬 Identify **unique genetic markers** characteristic of Neanderthals.  
- 🧠 Highlight **genomic regions that overlap with modern humans**.  
- 📊 Generate a report summarizing potential **ancestral traits**.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- An analysis indicating **genetic links and unique markers** between ancient and modern genomes.
