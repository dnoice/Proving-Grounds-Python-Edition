# 🔄 Blockchain Integrity Guard: Implementing a Blockchain Data Integrity Checker

---

## 📋 Overview
Blockchain technology is praised for its **decentralized nature** and **tamper-proof records**. But even blockchain data can be at risk if nodes get compromised or if errors occur during data transfer. Ensuring the **integrity of the blockchain** means verifying that no blocks have been altered or corrupted.

Your mission? Develop a **Python-based integrity checker** that validates the blockchain’s data by examining **hash links** and identifying any inconsistencies. 

---

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you’re responsible for maintaining the integrity of a small blockchain network that handles sensitive transaction data. Recently, there have been reports of data inconsistencies, and your team suspects a possible **integrity breach** in the blockchain. Your task is to build a tool that verifies each block’s data integrity, ensuring that no malicious alterations have occurred.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Loading and Parsing Blockchain Data
Start by getting the blockchain data in order. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 📥 Load a **blockchain file** (JSON or CSV format) containing block data (block number, hash, previous hash, timestamp, and transactions).  
- 🧩 Extract relevant fields and organize them into a **structured format** (like a DataFrame or dictionary).  
- 📝 Print a summary of the blockchain, including the **number of blocks**, **earliest timestamp**, and **latest timestamp**.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A cleanly structured representation of the blockchain, ready for integrity analysis.

### 🔬 Task 2: Verifying the Integrity of the Chain
Now it’s time to put your detective hat on and check the chain. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🔗 Validate the **hash chain** by ensuring that each block’s `previous_hash` matches the hash of the preceding block.  
- 🧮 Recompute the hash of each block from its contents and compare it to the stored hash.  
- 🚨 Flag any block where the hash chain breaks or the recalculated hash doesn’t match.  
- 📊 Generate a **report** showing any inconsistencies, including block number and nature of the error.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A report that clearly indicates whether the blockchain is **intact** or **corrupted**.

### 🔧 Task 3: Detecting Tampering or Data Loss
Let’s dig deeper to find any signs of tampering. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🕵️ Scan for **anomalies** such as duplicate block numbers or missing blocks.  
- 💡 Check for **timestamp inconsistencies** (e.g., non-sequential timestamps).  
- 🗃️ Log any blocks that appear **out of order** or have **missing fields**.  
- 🔎 Identify any block that has **inconsistent transaction data** (e.g., malformed entries).  

**Expected Outcome:**
- An extended report highlighting potential tampering or corruption indicators.  

---

### 🖊️ Task 4: Automating the Integrity Check
Make it easy to run integrity checks periodically. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 📝 Write a script that can be run with a **single command** to verify the blockchain’s integrity.  
- 🔄 Schedule the script to run at regular intervals (e.g., every 24 hours) using a **cron job** or task scheduler.  
- 📧 Set up **email notifications** for any integrity violations.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A fully automated integrity checker that runs periodically and alerts when something’s off.
