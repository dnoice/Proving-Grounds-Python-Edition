# 🔑 Cryptographic Fort Knox: Hash Function Analysis for Blockchain Security

---

## 📋 Overview
At the heart of blockchain security lies the **hash function** – the mathematical powerhouse that ensures data integrity. But not all hash functions are created equal. From **SHA-256** to **Keccak**, each one has its strengths, weaknesses, and unique characteristics. 

Your mission? Develop a **Python-based analysis tool** that tests, compares, and visualizes different hash functions. Whether it’s speed, collision resistance, or randomness, your tool will put these algorithms through their paces.

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re part of a blockchain development team tasked with enhancing the **security of a decentralized application (DApp)**. As part of the security audit, your team needs a tool to analyze various **hashing algorithms** and determine which one offers the best balance of **speed, security, and efficiency**.
