# 🔐 Blockchain Identity Sentinel: Building a Blockchain-Based Identity Verification System

---

## 📋 Overview
In an increasingly digital world, verifying identity on the blockchain offers a way to ensure **data integrity** and **user authenticity** without relying on centralized systems. Blockchain can securely store identity data while allowing authorized verification.

Your mission? Build an **identity verification system** using blockchain as the backbone. You’ll develop a **Python-driven backend** that registers, verifies, and authenticates user identities. 

---

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re part of a development team working on a **decentralized identity platform** for a government project. Your task is to create a secure system where citizens can **register their identity**, and officials can **verify it** without exposing sensitive data. The system must be **tamper-proof**, easily accessible, and verifiable on demand.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Setting Up the Identity Blockchain
Let’s create the foundation. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🗃️ Define the **block structure** to hold identity data (user ID, hash of personal details, timestamp, public key).  

- 🔑 Implement a **registration function** that takes user data, hashes it, and stores the hash on the blockchain.  

- 📝 Ensure the system **encrypts sensitive data** before storing it.  

- 🌱 Store the **public keys** for later verification.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A blockchain that securely stores hashed identity data with encryption.  

---

### 🔬 Task 2: Identity Verification Mechanism
Make sure identities can be verified reliably. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 📄 Create a **verification function** that compares a given identity hash against the blockchain record.  

- 🔑 Use **public-private key cryptography** to sign verification requests.  

- 🔄 Implement a **challenge-response protocol** to verify user authenticity.  

- 📝 Log all verification attempts for future auditing.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A reliable and secure identity verification process with logging capabilities.  

---

### 🔧 Task 3: Secure Data Access and Privacy
Keep data safe while allowing legitimate access. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🔒 Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** to ensure only authorized personnel can view identity data.  

- 🧩 Develop a **hash comparison tool** that verifies data without revealing the original input.  

- 🌐 Build an **API endpoint** that allows third-party systems to request identity verification.  

- 🛡️ Implement a **rate limiter** to prevent abuse of the verification endpoint.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- An API that balances secure data access with privacy protection.  

---

### 🖊️ Task 4: Integration and Maintenance
Make the system resilient and easy to maintain. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌱 Set up a **continuous monitoring system** to detect unauthorized access attempts.  

- 📧 Send **automated alerts** if suspicious activity is detected.  

- 🔄 Implement **backup and restore procedures** for the identity blockchain.  

- 📑 Provide **detailed documentation** for deploying and maintaining the system.  

**Expected Outcome:**
- A resilient and well-documented system with robust monitoring and recovery features.  

---

## 📦 Deliverables
- **💻 Code Implementation:**  
  - Python scripts for blockchain setup, identity registration, and verification.  

- **🔐 API Interface:**  
  - A secure and documented API for identity verification requests.  

- **📑 Documentation:**  
  - Setup, usage, and maintenance instructions.
