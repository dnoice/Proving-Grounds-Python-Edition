# 🛠️ Modeling Cryptocurrency Price Dynamics

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on modeling and analyzing the dynamics of cryptocurrency prices using quantitative methods. You will use Python to implement statistical and machine learning techniques that capture the complex behavior of crypto markets, including volatility, trends, and abrupt changes in price.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are a quantitative analyst at a financial technology firm specializing in digital assets. Your goal is to develop models that predict cryptocurrency price movements to inform trading strategies and risk management. By exploring historical data and applying time series analysis, regression models, and machine learning algorithms, you will uncover patterns and factors that drive price fluctuations in a highly volatile market.

  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 💻 Compute key statistical metrics (mean, variance, volatility) of the price data.
    - 📊 Generate visualizations such as line charts, histograms, and scatter plots to observe trends and volatility.
    - 🔍 Engineer features such as moving averages, momentum indicators, and lagged price variables to capture temporal dependencies.

### 🔧 Task 3: Modeling Price Dynamics
- **Task Description:** Develop models to capture and forecast cryptocurrency price dynamics.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - ⚡ Implement time series models (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH) to analyze and forecast volatility.
    - 🔄 Explore machine learning approaches such as regression models or neural networks to predict future price movements.
    - 🛠️ Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and compare different modeling approaches.

### 🖊️ Task 4: Documentation and Reporting
- **Task Description:** Document your methodology, experimental results, and insights.
