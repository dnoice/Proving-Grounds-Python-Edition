## 💡 Stuck? No Problem!
Calculus can feel like stepping into a maze, but you’ve got the tools to navigate it. If you hit a wall, keep these tips in mind:

- 🪜 **Break it Down:** Start by understanding the fundamental math before diving into complex implementations. Calculus problems often get tricky when multiple steps intertwine – tackle them one at a time.  

- 🧭 **Visualize the Problem:** Graphs and plots are your allies. Visualizing the function and its derivatives can make patterns clear and reveal insights that aren’t obvious from equations alone.  

- 📝 **Test on Simple Cases:** If your model isn’t working as expected, simplify the problem. Test your functions with **basic scenarios** to ensure the calculations are correct.  

- 🔧 **Use Libraries to Your Advantage:** Python packages like **SymPy** and **SciPy** can handle symbolic math and numerical integration – make the most of them!  

- 🌱 **Learn from Mistakes:** If your solution diverges or the gradient descent stalls, adjust the learning rate, revisit your derivatives, or recheck your boundary conditions.
