## 📋 Overview
Calculus isn’t just about finding slopes and areas – it’s a powerhouse for **optimization**. Whether you’re minimizing costs, maximizing efficiency, or fine-tuning a process, derivatives give you the tools to find those **critical points** where things hit their peak (or valley).

Your mission? Use **derivative-based methods** to model and solve **real-world optimization problems**. You’ll be calculating derivatives, finding critical points, and using **gradient-based algorithms** to optimize scenarios.
