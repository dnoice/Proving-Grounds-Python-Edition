**Numerical Integration Techniques for Irregular Functions: A Computational Calculus Challenge**

*Here's the lowdown:*  
Develop a Python-based tool to evaluate integrals of irregular functions using numerical integration methods such as the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, and Monte Carlo integration. You‚Äôll analyze the accuracy and efficiency of each method for handling functions with discontinuities, sharp peaks, or non-standard behavior.

## üåç Scenario

Many functions in real-world applications do not lend themselves to easy analytical integration. Numerical methods become essential for approximating these integrals. In this challenge, you'll:
- Choose one or more irregular functions that are challenging to integrate analytically.
- Implement several numerical integration techniques.
- Compare the results and analyze the trade-offs between accuracy and computational load.

This hands-on project deepens your understanding of numerical methods while solving practical integration problems encountered in engineering and science.
