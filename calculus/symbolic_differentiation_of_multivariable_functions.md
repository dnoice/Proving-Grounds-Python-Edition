# 🔍 Symbolic Sorcery: Differentiating Multivariable Functions with Python

---

## 📋 Overview
Ever wondered how to compute derivatives when your function doesn’t just depend on one variable, but **two, three, or even more**? Symbolic differentiation is like having a **mathematical detective** that uncovers the **rate of change** for every variable at once. 

Your mission? Develop a **Python-based differentiation engine** that can handle **multivariable functions** with precision and speed. You’ll calculate **partial derivatives, gradients, and Jacobians**, making it possible to analyze complex systems where variables intertwine.

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re working in a **research lab** focused on modeling **biomechanical systems**. Your latest challenge is analyzing how **forces and displacements** interact within a multi-joint robotic arm. To optimize the arm’s movement, you need to calculate how **each joint angle** influences the overall motion. Symbolic differentiation will help you break down the **math of movement**.
