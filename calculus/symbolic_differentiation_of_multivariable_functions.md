## üåç Scenario

In multivariable calculus, understanding the behavior of functions of several variables is key for tasks ranging from optimization to differential equations. Symbolic differentiation not only automates tedious derivative calculations but also provides exact representations of derivatives. In this challenge, you'll:
- Define multivariable functions.
- Compute symbolic partial derivatives and gradients.
- Derive higher-order derivatives to study curvature and concavity.

This project bridges theoretical calculus with powerful computational tools, making it a valuable exercise for anyone working with complex mathematical models.
