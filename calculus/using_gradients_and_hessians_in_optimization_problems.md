## üìù Problem Title

**Using Gradients and Hessians in Optimization Problems: A Calculus Optimization Challenge**

*Here's the lowdown:*  
Develop a Python-based optimization tool that leverages the gradient vector and Hessian matrix of a multivariable function to find its local optima. You'll learn how to implement methods like Newton's method, discuss convergence criteria, and interpret the results of your optimization.

## üåç Scenario

Optimization is everywhere‚Äîfrom machine learning to engineering design‚Äîand using calculus can provide powerful insights into function behavior. In this challenge, you'll:
- Define a multivariable function representing a real-world scenario.
- Compute its gradient and Hessian symbolically or numerically.
- Use these derivatives to implement optimization techniques, speeding up convergence to local minima or maxima.

By understanding how gradients indicate the steepest ascent (or descent), and how the Hessian reflects curvature, you'll harness calculus to navigate complex optimization landscapes.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Define the Optimization Problem**  
   - **Task 1-a:** Choose or define a multivariable objective function \( f(x, y, \ldots) \) to optimize (minimize or maximize).  
   - **Task 1-b:** Clearly define initial conditions or starting points for the optimization process.

2. **Compute Gradients and Hessians**  
   - **Task 2-a:** Use symbolic (or numerical) methods to calculate the gradient \( \nabla f \).  
   - **Task 2-b:** Compute the Hessian matrix \( H(f) \) to capture second-order derivatives.

3. **Optimization Implementation**  
   - **Task 3-a:** Implement an optimization algorithm (e.g., Newton's method) using the gradient and Hessian to iteratively approach the optimum.  
   - **Task 3-b:** Ensure your algorithm includes convergence criteria and handles cases where the Hessian is singular or non-positive definite.

4. **Visualization and Analysis**  
   - **Task 4-a:** Plot the function's contour lines along with the optimization path to visually interpret the algorithm's progress.
   - **Task 4-b:** Analyze how the gradient and Hessian influence convergence rates and the stability of the solution.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**  
   - **Task 5-a:** Document your implementation with detailed comments explaining the role of each derivative in the optimization process.
   - **Task 5-b:** Prepare a report summarizing your methodology, optimization results, convergence analysis, and the significance of gradient and Hessian information in solving the problem.
