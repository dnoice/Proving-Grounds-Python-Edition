# 🌪️ Dancing on the Edge: Analyzing Sensitivity to Initial Conditions in Chaotic Systems

---

## 📋 Overview
Chaos theory isn’t just about **disorder** – it’s about the **fragile balance** where tiny changes can ripple into massive consequences. Think of it like trying to predict the path of a leaf caught in a swirling autumn wind. Even the smallest **shift in initial position** sends it spiraling in a completely different direction. 

Your challenge? Dive into chaotic systems and explore how **sensitive dependence on initial conditions** manifests. You’ll be working with **nonlinear equations**, crafting visualizations, and analyzing how seemingly minor changes **snowball into wild outcomes**.

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re part of a research team studying **atmospheric dynamics**. Your task is to model the **formation of turbulent air currents** over a cityscape, where even minor changes in temperature or wind speed can drastically alter **weather patterns**. By understanding how initial conditions affect the chaotic evolution of the system, you can make more **resilient predictive models**.
