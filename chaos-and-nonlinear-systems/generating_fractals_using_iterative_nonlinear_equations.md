# 🌌 Infinite Patterns: Generating Fractals Using Iterative Nonlinear Equations

---

## 📋 Overview
Fractals are like **nature’s abstract art**, created through **simple rules that repeat** infinitely. From **snowflakes to coastlines**, these patterns reveal the **beautiful chaos** hiding in mathematical equations. Generating fractals is all about using **iterative nonlinear equations** to build **self-similar structures** that stretch on forever.

Your challenge? Develop a Python script to generate and visualize **complex fractals** using iterative methods. You’ll explore famous fractals like the **Mandelbrot set**, the **Julia set**, and even create your own unique patterns.
