## 🌍 Scenario

Fractals are not just mathematically beautiful; they arise naturally in diverse areas from art to nature. In this project, you’ll:
- Define the iterative function (e.g., \( z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c \) for the Mandelbrot set).  
- Determine the convergence properties while iterating over a grid of complex numbers.
- Visualize the fractal with color mapping to represent the escape time.

This task enables you to merge mathematics and creative visualization to produce truly mesmerizing patterns.
