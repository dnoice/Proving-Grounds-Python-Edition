## üåç Scenario

Real ecological interactions often deviate from idealized linear models. Nonlinear dynamics can lead to richer behavior, such as limit cycles or multiple stable states. In this challenge, you‚Äôll:
- Extend the Lotka-Volterra equations with nonlinear interaction terms.  
- Simulate the system dynamics over time.
- Explore how these modifications affect the stability, amplitude, and periodicity of the population cycles.

This project deepens your understanding of ecological modeling while showcasing the power of nonlinear dynamic analysis.
