# 🐾 Survival of the Fittest: Modeling Predator-Prey Dynamics with Nonlinear Interactions

---

## 📋 Overview
Nature doesn’t follow straight lines – it weaves through **cycles, fluctuations, and unexpected turns**. In the animal kingdom, **predator-prey dynamics** are a prime example of this chaotic relationship. Small changes in one population can ripple through the ecosystem, leading to **booms and busts** in species numbers. 

Your challenge is to model this **chaotic interaction** using nonlinear equations. You’ll explore how **predator and prey populations** affect one another, implement **numerical simulations**, and visualize the **cyclic nature** of their relationship.

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re part of a wildlife conservation team studying the interactions between **wolves and deer** in a national park. Sudden changes in weather, disease outbreaks, or hunting regulations can dramatically affect the balance. By modeling these dynamics, you aim to predict population shifts and help maintain a **stable ecosystem**.
