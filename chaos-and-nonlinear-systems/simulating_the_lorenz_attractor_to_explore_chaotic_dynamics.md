## üåç Scenario

The Lorenz attractor is one of the most famous examples of chaos, emerging from a simplified model of atmospheric convection. In this challenge, you‚Äôll:
- Implement the Lorenz equations:
  \[
  \frac{dx}{dt} = \sigma(y - x), \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = x(\rho - z) - y, \quad \frac{dz}{dt} = xy - \beta z
  \]
- Numerically integrate these equations over time.
- Visualize the iconic butterfly curve that represents the attractor.

This hands-on simulation provides deep insights into chaotic dynamics and the delicate interplay between order and randomness.
