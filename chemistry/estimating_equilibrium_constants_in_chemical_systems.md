# ⚗️🧪 Chemistry: Estimating Equilibrium Constants in Chemical Systems

---

## 📋 Overview
Chemical reactions are rarely one-way trips. Instead, they often reach a **dynamic equilibrium** where reactants and products coexist in balance. Understanding this equilibrium is crucial for fields like **chemical engineering, biochemistry, and environmental science**. 

Your challenge here is to estimate **equilibrium constants (K)** for given chemical reactions using **Python**. This involves calculating the ratio of **product concentrations** to **reactant concentrations** at equilibrium, using mathematical models to predict how changes in conditions affect the balance.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you’re working in a **chemical research lab**, tasked with analyzing how temperature and pressure changes impact the equilibrium of a reaction mixture. Your goal is to develop a **Python-based tool** that can accurately calculate equilibrium constants and predict shifts in balance when conditions change.
