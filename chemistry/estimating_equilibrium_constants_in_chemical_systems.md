# ⚖️ Chemical Equilibrium: Estimating Equilibrium Constants

---

## 📋 Overview
Chemical reactions often reach a point where the **rate of the forward reaction** equals the **rate of the reverse reaction**. At this stage, the **concentrations of reactants and products** remain constant, defining the **chemical equilibrium**. The **equilibrium constant (K)** quantifies the ratio of products to reactants at equilibrium. 

Your challenge is to estimate the **equilibrium constant** for a given chemical reaction using **Python**. You will model the reaction dynamics, calculate equilibrium concentrations, and determine **K** under various conditions.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you’re working in a **chemical research lab** studying a reaction between **hydrogen (H₂)** and **iodine (I₂)** to form **hydrogen iodide (HI)**:  
\[
H_2(g) + I_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2HI(g)
\]
You need to calculate the **equilibrium constant (K)** for this reaction at different temperatures to understand how temperature affects the equilibrium position.
