# 🧬 Molecular Dynamics: Exploring Atomic Interactions

---

## 📋 Overview
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allow us to study the **motion of atoms and molecules** over time. By calculating the **forces and trajectories**, we can understand the **behavior of complex systems** at the atomic level. MD simulations are fundamental in **biophysics, chemistry, and materials science**, providing insights into **protein folding**, **material stability**, and **reaction dynamics**. 

Your challenge is to develop a **Python-based molecular dynamics simulation** that models the movement of particles based on **intermolecular forces** and **thermodynamic principles**.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you’re part of a **research team** studying the **structural stability of a new protein**. You need to simulate how the protein’s atoms interact over time, especially under varying **temperature and pressure** conditions. The goal is to predict **structural changes** and identify **stable configurations** using molecular dynamics.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Setting Up the Simulation Environment
Establish the simulation parameters and initialize the molecular system. 

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🧬 Define the **atom positions** and **velocities**.  
- 🌡️ Set the **temperature**, **pressure**, and **timestep** for the simulation.  
- 🗺️ Choose an **integration algorithm** (e.g., **Verlet**, **Velocity Verlet**).  

**Hint:** Start with a **simple molecule** like H₂ to validate your setup. Test your initialization by printing the **initial positions and velocities** to ensure they make sense.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A well-defined initial state for the simulation.
