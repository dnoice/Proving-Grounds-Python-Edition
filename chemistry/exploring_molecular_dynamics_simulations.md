# Exploring Molecular Dynamics Simulations

This exploration takes you into the world of molecular motion, where you'll simulate how molecules interact and move over time. Let's break it down: You‚Äôll build a Python-based molecular dynamics simulation to analyze the behavior of a set of particles using classical force fields and numerical integration.

## üìù Problem Title

**Exploring Molecular Dynamics Simulations: A Molecular Motion Challenge**

*Here's the lowdown:*  
Develop a Python simulation that models the dynamics of a molecular system. You‚Äôll initialize particle positions and velocities, calculate forces using simple potential energy functions, and integrate Newton‚Äôs equations of motion to observe molecular trajectories.

## üåç Scenario

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a powerful tool for investigating the properties and behavior of molecular systems‚Äîfrom proteins to liquids. In this challenge, you'll:
- Set up an initial state of particles and define an interatomic potential (e.g., Lennard-Jones potential).
- Numerically integrate their motion using methods such as the Verlet algorithm.
- Explore how energy and structure evolve over time in a confined system.

This simulation bridges physics, chemistry, and computation, allowing you to explore the microscopic world through dynamic simulations.
