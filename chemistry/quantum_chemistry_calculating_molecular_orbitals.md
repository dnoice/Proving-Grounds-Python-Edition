## üìù Problem Title

**Quantum Chemistry: Calculating Molecular Orbitals: A Molecular Orbital Challenge**

*Here's the lowdown:*
Develop a Python-based simulation or workflow using quantum chemistry libraries (such as PySCF or Psi4) to calculate molecular orbitals. You'll set up the molecular system, choose a basis set, and solve for the energy levels and orbitals. The goal is to visualize these orbitals to gain insights into chemical bonding and electron density.

## üåç Scenario

Understanding molecular orbitals is central to comprehending chemical reactivity and bonding. In this challenge, you'll:
- Set up a molecular system (like H\(_2\)O or CH\(_4\)).  
- Select an appropriate basis set and apply approximate methods (e.g., Hartree-Fock or Density Functional Theory).  
- Compute the molecular orbitals and visualize key features such as node patterns and electron density distributions.

This project blends computational chemistry with quantum mechanics, giving you a glimpse into the inner workings of molecules.
