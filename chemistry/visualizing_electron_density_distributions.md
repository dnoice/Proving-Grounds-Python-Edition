# ⚛️ Chemistry: Visualizing Electron Density Distributions

---

## 📋 Overview
Electron density distributions provide a detailed picture of where **electrons** are most likely to be found around atoms and molecules. Visualizing these distributions is essential in understanding **chemical bonding**, **molecular interactions**, and the **shape of orbitals**. By simulating electron density distributions, we can gain insights into **molecular reactivity** and **stability**.

Your task is to develop a **Python-based tool** that calculates and visualizes the **electron density distribution** for a simple molecule, using **quantum mechanical methods** such as **Hartree-Fock** or **Density Functional Theory (DFT)**.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are working as part of a **computational chemistry team** tasked with studying the **electron density** of a small molecule like **water (H₂O)** or **ammonia (NH₃)**. Understanding the electron distribution helps to predict how the molecule interacts with other molecules, such as in **catalytic reactions** or **hydrogen bonding**.

The goal of this challenge is to **calculate the electron density distribution** using basic quantum chemistry principles and visualize the results in a way that helps to understand the molecular structure.
