## üìù Problem Title

**Visualizing Electron Density Distributions: An Electron Cloud Challenge**

*Here's the lowdown:*
Develop a Python-based tool that reads quantum chemistry output or computes electron densities from molecular orbitals. You‚Äôll use visualization libraries to create 2D contour plots or 3D density maps, showcasing how electrons are distributed around nuclei. This project blends quantum chemistry with data visualization to reveal the hidden structure of matter.

## üåç Scenario

Electron density is a fundamental concept in quantum chemistry, dictating molecule reactivity and bonding. In this challenge, you'll:
- Obtain or compute molecular orbital information.
- Calculate the overall electron density from these orbitals.
- Visualize the density distributions, highlighting regions of electron concentration (e.g., bonding and lone pair regions).

By visualizing electron density, you gain insights into molecular structure and chemical reactivity, bridging theory with observable properties.
