**Bridge Design Simulations: Analyzing Load Distribution: A Structural Engineering Challenge**

*Here's the lowdown:*
Develop a Python-based simulation that models a bridge‚Äôs structure under various loading conditions. You‚Äôll calculate stress concentrations, analyze load paths, and validate your design against engineering standards. This project combines simulation, finite element analysis, and real-world design constraints to ensure your bridge can withstand expected loads.

## üåç Scenario

In the field of civil engineering, designing bridges that can safely distribute loads is critical. In this challenge, you'll simulate a bridge under different loading scenarios‚Äîsuch as uniform loads or point loads‚Äîand assess how the structure responds. Through this process, you'll learn how stress is distributed across the bridge and identify potential areas of weakness that may require reinforcement.
