**Calculating Structural Strength in High-Wind Environments: A Wind Engineering Challenge**

*Here's the lowdown:*
Develop a Python simulation to assess the structural strength of buildings or bridges when subjected to high-wind forces. Using principles of fluid dynamics and structural mechanics, you'll calculate critical stress, strain, and deflection values, evaluating whether the design meets safety criteria.

## üåç Scenario

Extreme wind events can impose severe loads on structures. In this challenge, you'll model wind forces acting on a structure, compute resulting stresses and deflections, and compare your calculations with accepted engineering standards. This project integrates wind dynamics with structural analysis to promote resilient design.
