# 💧 The Flow Master: Optimizing Water Distribution Networks for Urban Systems

---

## 📋 Overview
Managing water distribution in bustling urban environments is no small feat. Networks must deliver water efficiently and reliably while adapting to varying demands and maintaining pressure stability. In this problem, you’ll design and optimize a water distribution network, balancing flow rates, pressure, and efficiency across a dynamic urban landscape.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Setting Up the Simulation Environment
Create a Python script to initialize network parameters and water demand scenarios.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🌐 Define network topology (junctions, pipes, pumps, reservoirs).
- 📏 Set pipe properties (length, diameter, roughness coefficient).
- 💦 Establish demand patterns (peak usage, low flow periods).

**💡 Tip:**
Use `numpy` to manage matrix representations of the network graph. Start by modeling a simple branching system before adding loops and complex junctions.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A script that sets up the network topology and demand scenarios.

### 🌊 Task 2: Flow Rate and Pressure Calculation
Implement methods to calculate flow rates and pressure throughout the network.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🧩 Apply the Hardy Cross method for looped network analysis.
- 📝 Incorporate the Hazen-Williams equation to estimate head loss.
- 🚰 Adjust pump performance to maintain pressure stability.

**💡 Tip:**
Matrix inversion can simplify the calculation of flow adjustments. Use sparse matrices for larger networks to optimize performance.

**🔧 Troubleshooting:**
If the simulation yields negative flow rates or pressure, double-check the boundary conditions and continuity equations.

**Expected Outcome:**
- A model that accurately calculates flow distribution and pressure at key points.

### 🛠️ Task 3: Network Optimization
Explore strategies to enhance the network's efficiency and resilience.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🔄 Implement flow balancing to minimize energy consumption.
- 🏭 Test different pipe diameters and materials to reduce head loss.
- 💡 Develop a contingency plan for pump failures.

**💡 Tip:**
Use gradient-based optimization methods to adjust pipe diameters iteratively. Implement a cost function that balances efficiency and material costs.

**Expected Outcome:**
- An optimized water distribution model with reduced energy consumption.
