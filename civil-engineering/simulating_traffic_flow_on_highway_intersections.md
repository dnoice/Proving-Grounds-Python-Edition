## üåç Scenario

Highway intersections are crucial nodes where traffic congestion and delays can occur. In this challenge, you'll model an intersection by simulating vehicle arrivals, departures, and signal phase impacts. By adjusting parameters like signal timing and lane configurations, you'll explore strategies to minimize congestion and enhance traffic throughput.
