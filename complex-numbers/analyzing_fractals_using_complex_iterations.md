2. **Implement Iterative Calculations**
   - **Task 2-a:** Write a Python script to iterate the chosen function for a set number of iterations.  
   - **Task 2-b:** Track which points remain bounded and which diverge, assigning iteration counts to each point.

3. **Visualization of Fractal Patterns**
   - **Task 3-a:** Use visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib or Plotly) to plot the fractal, using color mapping based on iteration counts.  
   - **Task 3-b:** Annotate your plot to highlight regions of convergence and divergence.

4. **Analysis and Interpretation**
   - **Task 4-a:** Analyze the impact of changing the constant \( c \) or initial conditions on the fractal structure.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Discuss the mathematical significance of the observed patterns in the context of complex dynamics.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - **Task 5-a:** Document your code with clear inline comments explaining each iteration step.  
   - **Task 5-b:** Summarize your findings in a report, detailing parameter effects and the fractal‚Äôs characteristics.
