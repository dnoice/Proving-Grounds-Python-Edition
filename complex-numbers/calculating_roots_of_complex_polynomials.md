## 📝 Problem Tasks

### 🧠 Task 1: Setting Up the Complex Polynomial Environment
Start by creating a Python script to define and manage complex polynomials.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 📝 Accept polynomial coefficients as input, supporting both real and complex numbers.  
- 🔄 Format the polynomial in a readable form (e.g., z^3 + (2+3i)z^2 + 5z + (1-i)).  
- 📜 Implement error handling to manage malformed or inconsistent input.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Polynomials can be messy, especially when coefficients mix real and complex numbers. Proper formatting helps visualize the equation and prevents errors down the line. 

**Tip:**  
Use `numpy.poly1d` for polynomial representation. It offers handy methods for differentiation, integration, and formatting.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A well-organized script that reads complex coefficients and formats them into a neat polynomial equation.

### 🔍 Task 2: Calculating the Roots of the Polynomial
Develop a method to calculate the complex roots efficiently.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 📐 Implement numerical root-finding methods suitable for complex coefficients.  
- 🔄 Choose an algorithm that balances efficiency and accuracy (e.g., Durand-Kerner or Bairstow’s method).  
- ✅ Verify the accuracy of calculated roots using polynomial evaluation (i.e., substituting roots back into the equation).  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Roots of complex polynomials may have conjugate pairs or lie far from the origin. An efficient algorithm ensures accuracy without excessive computation.  

**Tip:**  
Leverage `numpy.roots` for quick solutions but explore implementing at least one manual method for deeper understanding.  
Watch out for numerical instability when dealing with polynomials of high degree or coefficients with large imaginary parts.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A script that calculates and verifies roots with minimal error.

---

### 📊 Task 3: Visualizing the Roots
Create a visual representation of the roots in the complex plane.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 📍 Plot the calculated roots on the complex plane using Cartesian coordinates (real vs. imaginary parts).  
- 🌐 Highlight conjugate pairs and annotate each root with its corresponding polynomial value to demonstrate accuracy.  
- 🎨 Customize the plot to clearly distinguish between real and imaginary components.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Visualization helps identify symmetry and clustering patterns in root distributions, which is crucial for applications in physics and engineering.  

**Tip:**  
Use `matplotlib` for plotting. Employ `plt.scatter` for the roots and annotate each with `plt.text`.  
Include a grid and axis labels to improve clarity.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A visual representation that intuitively displays the distribution of complex roots.  

---

### 🪄 Task 4: Analyzing the Accuracy and Performance
Benchmark and validate your root-finding methods.

**Sub-tasks:**

- ⏱️ Measure the computational time for each method and compare them.  
- 📈 Analyze the error by comparing the calculated roots with the actual roots (if known).  
- 🔧 Fine-tune the algorithm for efficiency in handling polynomials of varying degrees.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Some methods may work well for low-degree polynomials but struggle with higher degrees or coefficients of vastly different magnitudes.  

**Tip:**  
Use `time` for performance measurement and `numpy.polyval` for root validation.  
Compare your method’s results with `numpy.roots` as a baseline.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
Performance metrics and accuracy comparisons for different root-finding methods.
