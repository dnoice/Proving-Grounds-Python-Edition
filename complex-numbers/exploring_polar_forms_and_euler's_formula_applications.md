## 📝 Problem Tasks

### 🧠 Task 1: Converting Complex Numbers to Polar Form
Start by creating a script to convert complex numbers between Cartesian (rectangular) and polar forms.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 🔄 Accept a complex number as input (either Cartesian or polar format).  
- 📏 Calculate the modulus r and argument \theta from a given complex number z = x + yi.  
- 💡 Display the polar representation in the form re^{i\theta} and (r, \theta).  
- ↔️ Implement the inverse transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Polar form is essential when dealing with rotations and oscillations, making it fundamental in physics and engineering applications.  

**Tip:**  
Use Python's `cmath` library to compute the modulus and argument efficiently:  
- `cmath.polar(z)` to get (r, theta).  
- `cmath.rect(r, theta)` to convert back to Cartesian form.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A Python script that converts complex numbers between Cartesian and polar forms seamlessly.

### 🧩 Task 2: Verifying Euler’s Formula
Implement a function to verify Euler's formula:  
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta)
\]

**Sub-tasks:**

- 📝 Write a function that takes an angle \theta and computes both sides of Euler's formula.  
- ✅ Compare the results to ensure numerical equivalence.  
- 📊 Plot the real and imaginary components to visually confirm the relationship.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Euler’s formula is fundamental in expressing complex exponentials and analyzing periodic functions, which are key in wave theory and signal processing.  

**Tip:**  
Use `cmath.exp(1j * theta)` to directly calculate e^{i\theta}.  
Compare with `cmath.cos(theta) + 1j * cmath.sin(theta)`.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A script that demonstrates and visually confirms Euler’s formula.

### 📊 Task 3: Visualizing Rotations in the Complex Plane
Illustrate how multiplying a complex number by e^{i\theta} results in a rotation.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 🌀 Define a complex number z and an angle \theta.  
- 🔄 Multiply z by e^{i\theta} to rotate it.  
- 📍 Plot the original and rotated points on the complex plane.  
- 🪞 Visualize how varying \theta alters the rotation dynamically.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Rotation through multiplication is fundamental in signal modulation and in modeling oscillatory phenomena.  

**Tip:**  
Use `matplotlib` to plot the complex numbers before and after rotation, using arrows to indicate the transformation.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
An interactive plot showing the rotation effect for different angles.

### 🚦 Task 4: Applying Euler’s Formula in Signal Processing
Simulate a simple signal composed of multiple sine and cosine waves, represented using Euler’s formula.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 📡 Generate a composite signal S(t) = A \cdot e^{i\omega t} + B \cdot e^{-i\omega t}.  
- 🎼 Visualize the real and imaginary parts of the signal as functions of time.  
- 📈 Analyze the amplitude modulation and phase shift as the parameters change.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Many signal processing techniques, like Fourier analysis, rely on representing signals as sums of exponentials. This task bridges theory with practical analysis.  

**Tip:**  
Use `numpy` for generating time-series data and `matplotlib` for visualization.  
Animate the signal to show how changes in frequency and amplitude affect the waveform.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A signal analysis script that demonstrates how Euler’s formula simplifies wave representation and manipulation.
