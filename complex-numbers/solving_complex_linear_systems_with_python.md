## 📝 Problem Tasks

### 🧠 Task 1: Setting Up the Complex Linear System
Start by creating a script to define and represent complex linear systems.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 🔢 Accept the coefficients and constants of the linear system as input (complex numbers allowed).  
- 📝 Represent the system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the variable matrix, and B is the constant matrix.  
- 📑 Implement input validation to handle inconsistent or malformed data.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Setting up the problem correctly ensures numerical stability and makes solving the system more straightforward.  

**Tip:**  
Use `numpy.array` to store coefficients and constants. It supports complex numbers naturally and allows efficient matrix operations.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A well-organized script that initializes and represents complex linear systems.

### 🔧 Task 2: Solving the System Using Direct Methods
Implement methods to find solutions using direct approaches.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 📐 Use Gaussian elimination to solve the system manually.  
- 🔄 Implement matrix inversion to find solutions (when the matrix is non-singular).  
- ✅ Cross-check results using `numpy.linalg.solve` as a reference.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Direct methods are computationally efficient for small to medium-sized systems and provide exact solutions when the matrix is well-conditioned.  

**Tip:**  
- For manual Gaussian elimination, decompose the matrix step by step and track pivoting for numerical stability.  
- Use `numpy.linalg.inv(A) @ B` for the matrix inversion method.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A script that correctly solves small to medium-sized complex linear systems using direct methods.

### 🔄 Task 3: Solving the System Using Iterative Methods
Develop methods for solving larger systems iteratively.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 🔁 Implement the Gauss-Seidel method for complex coefficients.  
- 🚀 Use the Conjugate Gradient method adapted for complex systems (if the matrix is Hermitian and positive-definite).  
- 🔄 Implement a convergence check to ensure the accuracy of iterative solutions.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Iterative methods are crucial when dealing with large systems where direct methods become computationally expensive.  

**Tip:**  
- Use the `scipy.sparse.linalg` library for efficient implementation of iterative solvers.  
- Set a tolerance level for convergence to balance precision and performance.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A robust script that efficiently solves large complex systems using iterative methods.

### 📊 Task 4: Visualizing the Solution Space
Create visual representations of the solutions and their convergence patterns.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 🗺️ Plot the solution vectors on the complex plane.  
- 📉 Visualize the convergence of iterative methods with respect to iteration count.  
- 🔍 Highlight the difference between solutions obtained from direct and iterative methods.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Visualizing the solution space helps identify patterns, convergence rates, and potential numerical instabilities.  

**Tip:**  
- Use `matplotlib` to plot the complex solution vectors as points or arrows.  
- Plot convergence as a graph of error versus iteration count.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
Graphs illustrating the solutions and convergence characteristics of different methods.

### 🚀 Task 5: Performance Benchmarking and Error Analysis
Evaluate the performance and accuracy of your methods.

**Sub-tasks:**

- ⏱️ Measure the computational time for each method.  
- 📈 Compare the accuracy of direct and iterative solutions for the same system.  
- 🔧 Analyze numerical stability by introducing small perturbations to the coefficient matrix.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Benchmarking ensures that the chosen method is appropriate for the problem size and complexity, while error analysis highlights the reliability of the solutions.  

**Tip:**  
- Use `time` for performance measurement.  
- Plot error magnitudes to visually assess the impact of perturbations.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A comprehensive comparison of methods in terms of speed, accuracy, and stability.
