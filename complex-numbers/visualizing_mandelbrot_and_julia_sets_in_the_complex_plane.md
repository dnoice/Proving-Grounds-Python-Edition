## 📝 Problem Tasks

### 🧠 Task 1: Setting Up the Complex Plane
Start by setting up a grid to represent the complex plane.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 🗺️ Define the resolution and boundaries of the complex plane (e.g., real and imaginary ranges).  
- 🔢 Create a meshgrid of complex numbers to serve as initial points for the iterative formula.  
- 📏 Ensure that the grid resolution balances detail and computational efficiency.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Fractals require precise representation of the complex plane to reveal intricate patterns without overwhelming computational resources.  

**Tip:**  
- Use `numpy.meshgrid` to efficiently create the complex grid.  
- Set boundaries like `[-2, 2]` for both the real and imaginary parts for the Mandelbrot set.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A structured complex plane that serves as the foundation for generating fractals.

### 🌈 Task 2: Generating the Mandelbrot Set
Implement the algorithm to generate the Mandelbrot set.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 🌱 Define the recursive formula:  
\[
  z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c
\]
  where z_0 = 0 and c is the complex coordinate from the grid.  
- 🔄 Iterate the formula, tracking how quickly the values escape to infinity.  
- 🌀 Assign a color based on the number of iterations before divergence (e.g., maximum iterations = black, faster divergence = bright colors).  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
The Mandelbrot set highlights the boundary between stability and chaos, where some points remain bounded while others escape to infinity.  

**Tip:**  
- Use a maximum iteration limit (e.g., 100) to balance performance and detail.  
- A point is considered divergent if its modulus exceeds 2.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A visually striking image of the Mandelbrot set, showcasing its chaotic boundary.

### 🌌 Task 3: Exploring Julia Sets
Adapt your script to generate Julia sets for different complex parameters.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 🌟 Modify the recursive formula to use a fixed complex parameter c and vary the initial point z_0:  
\[
  z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c
\]
- 🌀 Experiment with different values of c (e.g., c = -0.4 + 0.6i) and observe the resulting patterns.  
- 🎨 Create a side-by-side comparison of Mandelbrot and Julia sets to visualize their relationship.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
While the Mandelbrot set maps the parameter space of c, Julia sets map the dynamic behavior of the recursive process for fixed c.  

**Tip:**  
- Julia sets can vary drastically for small changes in c, so explore a variety of values.  
- Include an interactive component to adjust c and instantly see the changes.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A collection of Julia set visualizations, highlighting how the choice of c influences the fractal structure.  

---

### 📊 Task 4: Animating the Transformation
Create an animation that morphs between different Julia sets by varying the parameter c.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 🎥 Generate frames by gradually changing the real and imaginary parts of c.  
- 🌀 Compile the frames into a smooth animation.  
- 📽️ Add a title and axis labels to contextualize the transformation.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Seeing the smooth transformation between Julia sets visually demonstrates how subtle changes in parameters can drastically affect the fractal structure.  

**Tip:**  
- Use `matplotlib.animation` for generating the animation.  
- Keep the frame rate balanced to make transitions visually appealing.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A captivating animation that seamlessly morphs between different Julia set patterns.

### 🔧 Task 5: Performance Optimization
Refine your script for faster rendering.

**Sub-tasks:**

- 🚀 Implement multi-threading or GPU acceleration to boost performance.  
- 🧩 Use `numba` for JIT compilation of iteration loops.  
- ⏱️ Measure computation time before and after optimization.  

**💡 Why this matters:**  
Rendering fractals can be computationally intensive, especially for high-resolution images. Optimizing the process ensures smooth performance and scalability.  

**Tip:**  
- Use `@numba.jit` to optimize the iteration process.  
- Test the script with different resolutions to gauge performance improvements.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
An optimized script that significantly reduces computation time without sacrificing visual quality.
