## üìù Problem Title

**Visualizing Mandelbrot and Julia Sets in the Complex Plane: A Fractal Visualization Challenge**

*Here's the lowdown:*
Develop a Python-based simulation that generates and visualizes the Mandelbrot set and corresponding Julia sets. You‚Äôll iterate complex functions, map iteration counts to colors, and compare the behavior of the two sets to reveal the underlying fractal structures.

## üåç Scenario

The Mandelbrot set and Julia sets are beautiful manifestations of complex dynamics. In this challenge, you‚Äôll:
- Compute the Mandelbrot set by iterating the function \( z \mapsto z^2 + c \) and determining convergence criteria across a grid in the complex plane.
- Generate Julia sets for various values of \( c \) to see how the structure changes.
- Visualize both sets with vibrant color mapping to highlight detailed fractal boundaries.

This project combines computational mathematics with stunning visual art, offering a window into the complexity of the fractal world.
