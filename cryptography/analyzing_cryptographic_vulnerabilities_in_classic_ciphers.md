## üåç Scenario

Classic ciphers, while ingenious for their time, fail against today‚Äôs computational power. In this project, you‚Äôll:
- Implement ciphers like Caesar and Vigen√®re.
- Test their vulnerabilities using tools such as brute force or statistical attacks.
- Analyze how these weaknesses paved the way for modern cryptography.

This hands-on challenge explores the cryptographic principles of the past and demonstrates why they no longer suffice in secure communications.
