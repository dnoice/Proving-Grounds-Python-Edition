# 🔐 Cracking the Code: Analyzing Cryptographic Vulnerabilities in Classic Ciphers

---

## 📋 Overview  
Classic ciphers, once considered secure, have been outpaced by modern cryptographic techniques. Yet, they still hold educational value and can shed light on the evolution of encryption. In this challenge, you will analyze the vulnerabilities of classic ciphers, understanding why they fail against modern cryptanalysis. 

Your mission is to dissect, exploit, and understand weaknesses in a series of classic encryption methods, focusing on how and why they can be broken. From frequency analysis to brute force, you'll explore the cryptanalytic techniques that render these ciphers obsolete.

## 🌍 Scenario  
You are a cryptographer analyzing the security of a set of encrypted messages intercepted from an outdated communication system. The system uses classic ciphers like Caesar, Vigenère, and Substitution ciphers. Your goal is to identify the encryption method used and break the cipher, demonstrating why these techniques are vulnerable to modern attacks.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Identifying the Cipher Type  
First, you need to determine which cipher was used to encrypt the message. Classic ciphers often exhibit unique patterns that can give away their nature.

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 🔍 Perform a preliminary analysis to identify distinguishing features (e.g., letter frequency, repeating patterns).  
- 📝 Develop a script to calculate letter frequencies and find repeating sequences.  
- 🔑 Compare the patterns against known characteristics of common ciphers (e.g., Caesar, Vigenère, Substitution).  

**💡 Tip:**  
Start by analyzing letter frequency. A Caesar cipher will maintain the frequency distribution of the plaintext, while a Vigenère cipher may show repeating patterns with a periodic key. The Substitution cipher often retains letter frequency but rearranges symbols.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A script that correctly identifies the cipher type based on the encrypted text.  
- A brief analysis explaining your reasoning.

### 🔑 Task 2: Decrypting the Message  
Once the cipher type is identified, your next move is to crack it and retrieve the original message.

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 🗺️ Implement decryption algorithms for Caesar, Vigenère, and Substitution ciphers.  
- 🛠️ Develop a brute-force method for Caesar and an automated frequency analysis for Substitution.  
- 🔄 For Vigenère, use Kasiski examination or frequency analysis to determine the key length.  

**💡 Tip:**  
For Caesar, brute-force is straightforward since there are only 25 possible shifts.  
For Vigenère, try finding repeated sequences to estimate the key length. Use frequency analysis to map the most common ciphertext characters to typical plaintext letters (like 'E').  
For Substitution, the challenge lies in correctly mapping letters. Start with the most frequent characters and test potential mappings.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- Scripts that can decrypt messages encoded with each cipher.  
- A decrypted message and a summary of the decryption process.

### 🕵️ Task 3: Analyzing Vulnerabilities  
Once decrypted, it’s time to dissect why the encryption method was weak and how modern cryptographic practices overcome these issues.

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 📑 Summarize the primary weaknesses of each cipher (e.g., fixed key length, frequency preservation).  
- 📊 Compare classic ciphers to modern encryption standards like AES and RSA.  
- 🚨 Explain why modern ciphers are resistant to the attacks you used.  

**💡 Tip:**  
Classic ciphers often fail due to predictable patterns or limited key space. Modern ciphers use techniques like large key sizes, randomized initialization vectors (IVs), and complex mathematical transformations to mitigate these vulnerabilities.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A detailed analysis report highlighting the weaknesses of classic ciphers.  
- A comparative analysis between classic and modern encryption.

### 🗺️ Task 4: Reporting and Visualization  
Visualization and structured reporting are essential to present your findings effectively.

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 📈 Create visual representations of frequency distributions for different ciphers.  
- 📑 Generate a report summarizing the cryptanalysis process and outcomes.  
- 📝 Include visualizations comparing classic ciphers' weaknesses to modern encryption robustness.  

**💡 Tip:**  
Use `matplotlib` for histograms and frequency analysis plots. Demonstrating how letter frequencies in ciphertexts mirror plaintext patterns can make vulnerabilities more evident.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A well-organized report with visualizations demonstrating the cryptographic weaknesses.
