## üìù Problem Title

**Simulating RSA Encryption and Decryption: A Cryptography Challenge**

*Here's the lowdown:*
Develop a Python-based simulation that demonstrates the full RSA process. You‚Äôll generate RSA keys from scratch, encrypt messages, and then decrypt them while verifying the correctness of your implementation. The aim is to understand the mathematical principles behind public-key cryptography and appreciate the security provided by the RSA algorithm.

## üåç Scenario

Imagine you‚Äôre the lead cryptographic engineer at a financial institution where data security is paramount. Recently, a breach in an external system has convinced your management that stronger encryption methods are needed. Your mission is to develop and test an RSA encryption system to secure sensitive transactions and communications. You must generate keys using large primes, construct the public and private exponents, and ensure that messages encrypted with your public key can only be decrypted with your private key. Your work will illustrate the power and reliability of RSA in protecting critical data.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Implement RSA Key Generation**
   - **Task 1-a:** Write Python functions to generate two large prime numbers (or use provided primes for demonstration).  
   - **Task 1-b:** Compute the modulus \( n = p \times q \) and Euler's totient function \( \phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) \).  
   - **Task 1-c:** Choose a public exponent \( e \) that is coprime with \( \phi(n) \) and compute the private exponent \( d \) such that \( e \times d \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n) \).

2. **Implement RSA Encryption**
   - **Task 2-a:** Develop a function that converts a plaintext message into an integer (using an appropriate encoding scheme).  
   - **Task 2-b:** Implement the encryption algorithm using the public key \( (e, n) \):  
     \[
     c = m^e \mod n
     \]
   - **Task 2-c:** Validate your encryption function with sample messages.

3. **Implement RSA Decryption**
   - **Task 3-a:** Write a Python function for decryption using the private exponent \( d \) and modulus \( n \):
     \[
     m = c^d \mod n
     \]
   - **Task 3-b:** Convert the resulting integer back to the original plaintext message.
   - **Task 3-c:** Ensure that decryption reliably recovers the original message from ciphertext.

4. **Validation and Testing**
   - **Task 4-a:** Perform end-to-end testing by encrypting a message and then decrypting it to confirm accuracy.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Analyze the performance and limitations when using smaller primes for demonstration versus realistic large primes.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - **Task 5-a:** Document your code with detailed inline comments explaining key mathematical concepts and algorithm steps.  
   - **Task 5-b:** Prepare a report summarizing the RSA process, including key generation, encryption, decryption, and analysis of security implications.
