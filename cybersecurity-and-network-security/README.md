# 🛡️ Cyber Security and Network Security | Proving Grounds | Python Edition  

---

## 🌟 Welcome to the Cyber Security and Network Security Proving Grounds  
In this category, you will embark on an exploration of network defense, threat detection, and cyber forensics. Cyber security is not just about keeping systems safe—it's about anticipating threats, analyzing network behavior, and implementing robust protection mechanisms. 

These challenges are designed to immerse you in the dynamic world of network security, where you will tackle tasks ranging from anomaly detection to real-time intrusion monitoring. Equip yourself with the skills needed to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats using Python.  

### 💡 What to Expect  
- **Threat Detection:** Identify and mitigate potential attacks using advanced machine learning techniques.  
- **Network Forensics:** Capture and analyze network data to trace intrusions and reconstruct attack paths.  
- **Security Automation:** Build tools that automate detection and response to cyber threats.  
- **Simulation and Mitigation:** Simulate cyber attacks and develop defense strategies to secure networks.
