# 🛠️ The Detective: Analyzing Network Traffic for Anomaly Detection

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on analyzing network traffic to detect anomalies and potential security threats. You will use Python to implement statistical and machine learning techniques to identify unusual patterns in network data, which may indicate cyber attacks or network failures.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are a cybersecurity analyst working in a Security Operations Center (SOC). Your task is to monitor network traffic and detect anomalies that may indicate malicious activities, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, data exfiltration, or intrusions. By implementing anomaly detection algorithms, you can quickly identify and respond to potential threats before they compromise the system.
