# 🕵️ Tracing the Intruder: Building a Network Forensics Toolkit for Incident Response

---

## 📋 Overview  
When a cyber incident occurs, rapid response is crucial to contain and analyze the breach. Network forensics focuses on capturing, recording, and analyzing network traffic to identify and mitigate threats. 

Your challenge is to develop a Python-based network forensics toolkit that can capture traffic, analyze suspicious patterns, and generate comprehensive incident reports. This toolkit will be invaluable for cybersecurity analysts performing post-attack investigations and root cause analysis.

---

## 🌍 Scenario  
You are part of a digital forensics team tasked with investigating a recent network breach. Your job is to develop a toolkit that can capture network packets, analyze potential threats, and generate detailed forensic reports. You will also implement basic data correlation techniques to trace the attacker's path and identify compromised systems.

## 📝 Problem Tasks  

### ⚙️ Task 1: Setting Up Packet Capture  
The first step in network forensics is capturing relevant data for analysis.

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 📥 Implement a packet sniffer using Python to capture live network traffic.  
- 📂 Save captured data in a structured format (e.g., PCAP, CSV).  
- 📝 Filter traffic by protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP) to reduce noise.  
- 💾 Store metadata such as timestamp, IP addresses, ports, and packet size.  

**💡 Tip:**  
Use the `scapy` library for capturing and filtering packets. Implement multi-threading to handle high-volume traffic efficiently.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A packet capture script that stores relevant network data in a structured file.  
- Filtered data with essential network information for later analysis.

### 🔍 Task 2: Analyzing Captured Traffic  
Once the data is captured, the next step is to identify suspicious patterns and indicators of compromise.

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 📊 Implement statistical analysis to identify traffic spikes, unusual IP connections, or protocol usage anomalies.  
- 🔑 Perform DNS and IP resolution to identify suspicious domains.  
- 🕵️ Flag common attack patterns (e.g., port scanning, DoS attempts, suspicious protocol usage).  
- 🗂️ Create visual summaries (e.g., top talkers, traffic by protocol) to highlight anomalies.  

**💡 Tip:**  
Leverage Python libraries like `pandas` for data analysis and `matplotlib` for visualizing trends. Cross-reference IP addresses with known threat databases to identify potential attackers.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A script that analyzes traffic logs and detects potential anomalies.  
- Visual reports showing traffic distribution and suspicious connections.  

---

### 🧠 Task 3: Incident Correlation and Tracing  
Forensic analysis involves connecting multiple data points to trace the incident's origin.

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 🌐 Correlate suspicious IP addresses with other network events (e.g., failed login attempts).  
- 🗺️ Create a network map to visualize the potential attack path.  
- 🧩 Use timestamp correlation to reconstruct the sequence of attack events.  
- 📝 Identify compromised systems based on unusual traffic patterns.  

**💡 Tip:**  
Implement graph-based visualization using `networkx` to map connections between suspicious IPs. Use timestamp alignment to piece together the attack timeline.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A correlation report detailing the sequence of events and attack vectors.  
- A network map showing how the intruder navigated the system.  

---

### 📝 Task 4: Reporting and Visualization  
Generate a structured forensic report to document the investigation process and findings.

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 📑 Compile a summary of detected anomalies, including IP addresses, ports, and timestamps.  
- 📝 Provide a detailed description of attack patterns and potential vulnerabilities.  
- 📊 Visualize the traffic trends before, during, and after the suspected intrusion.  
- 💡 Suggest mitigation strategies to prevent similar attacks in the future.  

**💡 Tip:**  
Use `Jinja2` to create structured HTML reports and include interactive visualizations using `Plotly` for deeper insights.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A comprehensive incident report with analysis, visualizations, and recommendations.  
- Clear documentation of the attack timeline and forensic findings.
