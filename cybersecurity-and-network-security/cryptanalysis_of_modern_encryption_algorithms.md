# 🛡️ Breaking the Unbreakable: Cryptanalysis of Modern Encryption Algorithms

---

## 📋 Overview  
Modern encryption algorithms like AES, RSA, and ECC form the backbone of secure communication today. However, even these advanced methods are not impervious to attack when improperly implemented. Cryptanalysis involves examining these algorithms to identify weaknesses, flaws, or potential exploits. 

Your challenge is to simulate cryptanalysis on modern encryption schemes, explore common vulnerabilities, and understand how real-world attacks might succeed against poorly configured systems. You will develop Python scripts to simulate attacks such as brute force, side-channel analysis, and known plaintext attacks.

## 🌍 Scenario  
You are a cybersecurity researcher tasked with evaluating the robustness of modern encryption algorithms used in a secure messaging application. Your objective is to identify potential vulnerabilities by simulating cryptographic attacks, analyzing their feasibility, and proposing stronger implementation practices.

## 📝 Problem Tasks  

### ⚙️ Task 1: Setting Up Encryption Schemes  
Start by implementing common encryption algorithms that you will later analyze. 

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 🛠️ Implement AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) using a symmetric key.  
- 🔑 Implement RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) for asymmetric encryption.  
- 🧮 Implement ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) for secure key exchange.  
- 📝 Test each encryption method with sample plaintext and compare encrypted outputs.  

**💡 Tip:**  
Use Python libraries like `pycryptodome` for AES and RSA, and `cryptography` for ECC. Focus on generating secure keys and encrypting short messages to start.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- Working encryption and decryption scripts for AES, RSA, and ECC.  
- Sample outputs demonstrating the encrypted and decrypted data.

### 🔍 Task 2: Simulating Cryptographic Attacks  
Test the resilience of your encryption implementations by simulating common attacks. 

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 🔓 Perform a brute force attack on a weak AES key (e.g., 56-bit DES).  
- 🪙 Simulate a chosen plaintext attack against AES with predictable input patterns.  
- 📊 Execute a timing attack on RSA to exploit key generation weaknesses.  
- 📉 Implement a simple side-channel attack on ECC by analyzing execution time.  

**💡 Tip:**  
Focus on simplified versions of these attacks to understand the principles. For brute force, limit key length for practical testing. For timing attacks, measure response times accurately using `time.perf_counter()`.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- Scripts demonstrating successful cryptographic attacks on weak implementations.  
- Analysis of how the attack succeeded and why the algorithm was vulnerable.

### 🕵️ Task 3: Analyzing Vulnerabilities  
After simulating attacks, analyze why these methods worked and how real-world systems mitigate such risks. 

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 💡 Summarize why weak keys (like in DES) are easily broken by brute force.  
- 📑 Explain why predictable input patterns make AES vulnerable to chosen plaintext attacks.  
- 📝 Discuss how timing leaks in RSA can expose private key information.  
- 🚨 Investigate ECC implementation flaws that could enable side-channel exploitation.  

**💡 Tip:**  
Refer to recent cryptographic research papers to understand real-world attacks. Identify how modern best practices, like key length and padding, mitigate these vulnerabilities.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A detailed report on cryptographic vulnerabilities, illustrated with examples from your simulations.  
- Recommendations for improving encryption security.

### 🗺️ Task 4: Visualization and Reporting  
Clear presentation is essential to demonstrate your findings. Generate insightful reports and visualizations.  

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 📈 Visualize the difference in brute force attack time between weak and strong AES keys.  
- 🗺️ Graph the response times of RSA operations to highlight timing attack risks.  
- 📝 Compile a comparative analysis of each algorithm’s strengths and weaknesses.  
- 📑 Generate a comprehensive report summarizing the cryptanalysis process and results.  

**💡 Tip:**  
Use `matplotlib` for plotting attack efficiency, and `pandas` for organizing timing data. Ensure that your visualizations clearly demonstrate the differences between secure and insecure configurations.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A visual and written report that presents cryptographic vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.
