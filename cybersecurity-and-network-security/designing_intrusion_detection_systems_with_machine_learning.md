# 🛠️ Designing Intrusion Detection Systems with Machine Learning

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on designing and implementing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) using machine learning techniques to identify potential threats and anomalies in network traffic. You will use Python to develop models that detect malicious activities by analyzing traffic patterns, abnormal behaviors, and network events.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are a cybersecurity engineer tasked with protecting a corporate network from cyber attacks. Your goal is to build an IDS that uses machine learning to detect suspicious activity, such as port scanning, unauthorized access, or unusual data flows. By training your model on labeled network traffic, you will create a system that can distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior in real time.

    - 🔍 Evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using cross-validation techniques.

### 🔧 Task 3: Real-Time Intrusion Detection
- **Task Description:** Deploy the trained model for real-time intrusion detection.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - ⚡ Set up a live data feed using tools like PyShark or Scapy to capture network packets.
    - 🔄 Integrate the trained model to analyze incoming traffic and generate alerts on potential intrusions.
    - 🛠️ Optimize the system for low latency and minimal false positives.

### 🖊️ Task 4: Documentation and Reporting
- **Task Description:** Document your IDS design, implementation, and evaluation results.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📄 Provide a clear description of your feature selection and model choice.
    - 📝 Prepare a report detailing the data preprocessing steps, model evaluation, and real-time performance.
    - 🖼️ Include visualizations like confusion matrices, ROC curves, and performance comparison plots.
