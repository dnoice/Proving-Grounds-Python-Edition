# 🛠️ Simulating DDoS Attack Mitigation Strategies

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on simulating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack scenarios and implementing mitigation strategies using Python. You will develop a simulation environment that models network traffic under attack, test various defense mechanisms, and evaluate their effectiveness in maintaining service availability.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are a network security engineer tasked with safeguarding a web service from DDoS attacks. Your objective is to simulate various types of DDoS attacks (such as SYN flood and HTTP GET flood) and implement countermeasures that reduce their impact. By analyzing the performance of mitigation techniques, you will identify the most effective methods for maintaining service integrity during an attack.
