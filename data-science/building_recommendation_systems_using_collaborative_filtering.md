# 🔍 Data-Driven Recommendations: Building Recommendation Systems Using Collaborative Filtering

---

## 📋 Overview  
Recommendation systems are integral to modern digital experiences, from suggesting movies on streaming platforms to recommending products in e-commerce. Collaborative filtering, a popular technique, leverages user behavior and preferences to make personalized suggestions. 

Your challenge is to build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. You will explore user-based and item-based methods, evaluate their performance, and enhance recommendations using hybrid approaches.

---

## 🌍 Scenario  
You are a data scientist at a streaming platform tasked with developing a personalized recommendation system. The goal is to improve user engagement by suggesting relevant movies based on past viewing history and similar user preferences. You will develop a Python-based system that analyzes user-item interactions and generates accurate recommendations.

## 📝 Problem Tasks  

### ⚙️ Task 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing  
The first step in building a recommendation system is to gather and preprocess data for analysis.

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 📥 Load a public dataset (e.g., MovieLens or Amazon Reviews) containing user ratings and item interactions.  
- 🧹 Handle missing values, normalize ratings, and encode categorical variables.  
- 📊 Create a user-item interaction matrix where rows represent users and columns represent items.  
- 📝 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of ratings and user activity.  

**💡 Tip:**  
Use libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation and `numpy` for matrix operations. Visualize rating distributions using `seaborn` to gain insights into data sparsity.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A cleaned and structured dataset ready for collaborative filtering.  
- Visualizations showing the distribution of ratings and user interactions.

### 🧠 Task 2: Building Collaborative Filtering Models  
There are two primary collaborative filtering methods: user-based and item-based. Implement both approaches and compare their effectiveness. 

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 👥 User-Based Filtering: Calculate user similarity using metrics like cosine similarity or Pearson correlation.  
- 🧩 Item-Based Filtering: Compute item similarity based on user ratings.  
- 📈 Generate top-N recommendations for a given user using both methods.  
- 🔄 Implement a hybrid model that combines user-based and item-based recommendations.  

**💡 Tip:**  
Use `scikit-learn` for calculating similarity metrics and `scipy` for matrix factorization. Implementing a sparse matrix representation can significantly reduce computation time.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- Scripts implementing user-based, item-based, and hybrid collaborative filtering.  
- Lists of recommended items for sample users.  

---

### 🔍 Task 3: Model Evaluation and Comparison  
Recommendation systems should be evaluated based on accuracy and relevance. 

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 📊 Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, and Precision@K to evaluate recommendation accuracy.  
- 📝 Perform cross-validation to assess model stability and generalizability.  
- 📈 Compare the performance of user-based, item-based, and hybrid approaches.  
- 💡 Generate insights on which model performs best for different types of users.  

**💡 Tip:**  
Leverage `scikit-learn`’s `train_test_split` for data partitioning and `mean_squared_error` for RMSE calculation. Plot the evaluation metrics to visualize model performance.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A detailed comparison of model accuracy and relevance metrics.  
- Insights on when to use user-based, item-based, or hybrid methods.

### 📝 Task 4: Real-Time Recommendation Engine  
Integrate the collaborative filtering models into a real-time recommendation engine.

**Sub-tasks:**  
- 🗃️ Build an API using `Flask` to serve recommendations on demand.  
- 🔄 Implement caching for frequently requested recommendations to enhance performance.  
- 📦 Package the model and API into a lightweight application.  
- 🚀 Test the system with simulated user input to verify real-time functionality.  

**💡 Tip:**  
Use `joblib` to serialize your models and speed up loading times. Implement API endpoints to return recommendations based on user ID or item ID.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A real-time recommendation engine accessible via API.  
- Demonstrated functionality with sample user requests.
