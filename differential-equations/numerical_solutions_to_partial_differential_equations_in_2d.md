## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Formulate the 2D PDE Model and Boundary Conditions**
   - **Task 1-a:** Choose the PDE to model your system, such as:  
     - Transient Heat Equation:  
       \[
       \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}\right)
       \]
       or  
     - Steady-State Laplace Equation:  
       \[
       \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0
       \]
   - **Task 1-b:** Define appropriate initial conditions (for transient problems) and boundary conditions (e.g., fixed temperatures, insulated boundaries, or periodic conditions) reflective of realistic thermal scenarios.

2. **Develop the Numerical Scheme**
   - **Task 2-a:** Discretize the spatial domain into a grid using a finite difference method.  
   - **Task 2-b:** For time-dependent problems, choose an explicit or implicit time-stepping method (e.g., Forward Euler or Crank-Nicolson) ensuring stability (check the CFL condition when necessary).  
   - **Task 2-c:** Formulate the finite difference equations that approximate the differential operators in your chosen PDE.

3. **Implement the Solver in Python**
   - **Task 3-a:** Write Python code (using NumPy for array operations) to set up the grid, implement the finite difference scheme, and iteratively solve the approximate PDE over the domain and time (if transient).  
   - **Task 3-b:** Verify your implementation on a test case (e.g., comparing against an analytical solution for a simplified setup).

4. **Visualization and Analysis**
   - **Task 4-a:** Use visualization libraries (Matplotlib or Plotly) to create color maps, surface plots, or heat maps to display the temperature (or potential) distribution over the 2D domain.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Generate animated plots for transient simulations to illustrate how the solution evolves over time.  
   - **Task 4-c:** Annotate visualizations with key features (e.g., steady state attainment, gradient regions) and discuss the physical insights obtained.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - **Task 5-a:** Document your Python code thoroughly with inline comments, explaining the derivation of the numerical scheme and any assumptions made.  
   - **Task 5-b:** Prepare a comprehensive report outlining your methodology, challenges encountered (e.g., ensuring numerical stability), simulation results, and practical implications for thermal management in electronics.
