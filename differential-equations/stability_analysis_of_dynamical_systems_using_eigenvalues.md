# Stability Analysis of Dynamical Systems Using Eigenvalues

This exploration immerses you in the numerical and theoretical world of stability analysis. Let’s break it down: You’ll model a linear dynamical system, compute its eigenvalues, and analyze their real parts to determine system stability. This exercise highlights how eigenvalues serve as a key indicator of whether small perturbations die out or amplify over time.

**Stability Analysis of Dynamical Systems Using Eigenvalues: A Dynamical Systems Challenge**

*Here's the lowdown:*
Develop a Python-based approach to assess the stability of a linear dynamical system represented by the differential equation \( \frac{dx}{dt} = A x \). You’ll compute the eigenvalues of the matrix \(A\) and analyze their real parts to determine whether the system is stable (all eigenvalues have negative real parts) or unstable (if any eigenvalue has a positive real part).

## 🌍 Scenario

Imagine you’re a systems engineer at an aerospace company tasked with ensuring that the control system for a new satellite is stable. The satellite's attitude dynamics can be approximated by a linear system of differential equations where the matrix \(A\) encapsulates the system’s feedback characteristics. Your mission is to compute the eigenvalues of \(A\) and determine if the satellite's orientation system will dampen out perturbations or, conversely, amplify them into dangerous instabilities. The insights you derive will be critical in fine-tuning the control design to guarantee safe and reliable operation in orbit.

## 🔧 Problem Tasks

1. **Model the Linear Dynamical System**
   - **Task 1-a:** Define a representative system matrix \(A\) for a linear dynamical system (e.g., a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix).  
   - **Task 1-b:** Describe the physical meaning or assumptions behind your choice of \(A\), and set up the differential equation \( \frac{dx}{dt} = A x \).

2. **Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**
   - **Task 2-a:** Use Python (with NumPy or SciPy) to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix \(A\).  
   - **Task 2-b:** Analyze the computed eigenvalues graphically—plot them in the complex plane to visualize their real and imaginary parts.

3. **Stability Assessment**
   - **Task 3-a:** Determine stability by evaluating the real parts of the eigenvalues (i.e., the system is stable if every eigenvalue’s real part is negative).  
   - **Task 3-b:** Discuss how different configurations of eigenvalue locations (real parts, complex conjugate pairs) influence the system’s response to disturbances.

4. **Comparison and Sensitivity Analysis**
   - **Task 4-a:** Modify the system matrix parameters to simulate different scenarios (e.g., increased damping or enhanced feedback) and repeat the eigenvalue analysis.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Analyze the sensitivity of stability to changes in matrix parameters and identify critical thresholds where the system transitions from stable to unstable.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - **Task 5-a:** Thoroughly document your Python implementation with inline comments describing key steps: matrix definition, eigenvalue computation, and stability criteria.  
   - **Task 5-b:** Prepare a clear report summarizing your findings, including plots of eigenvalue distributions, interpretations of stability properties, and recommendations for parameter adjustments to ensure system robustness.

## 🎁 Bonus Section (Advanced Challenge)

1. **Interactive Parameter Exploration:**
   - Develop an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Plotly Dash that allows users to adjust the entries of matrix \(A\) in real time and instantly view the resulting eigenvalue plot and stability classification.

2. **Nonlinear Extension:**
   - Extend your analysis to a nonlinear system by linearizing it around critical points and then performing an eigenvalue stability analysis on the Jacobian matrix.

3. **Time-Domain Simulation Integration:**
   - Integrate your eigenvalue analysis with a time-domain simulation of the dynamical system, comparing predicted stability (based solely on eigenvalues) with actual system response over time under small perturbations.

4. **Case Study Application:**
   - Apply your stability analysis framework to a real-world case (e.g., mechanical vibrations in a structure or population dynamics in an economic model) and validate your conclusions against observational data.
