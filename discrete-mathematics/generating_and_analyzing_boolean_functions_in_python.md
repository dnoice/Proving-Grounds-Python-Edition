**Generating and Analyzing Boolean Functions in Python: A Digital Logic Challenge**

*Here's the lowdown:*
Develop a Python-based toolkit to generate, analyze, and simplify Boolean functions. You‚Äôll construct truth tables for given Boolean expressions, examine their structural properties, and utilize Boolean algebra to simplify or transform these functions with an emphasis on applications in digital circuits and decision systems.

## üåç Scenario

Imagine you're a digital circuit designer at a leading tech firm tasked with optimizing logic circuits for next-generation hardware. Your job is to explore various Boolean functions, identify those with desirable properties (such as minimal complexity or balanced outputs), and simplify logic expressions to reduce circuit size and energy consumption. Using Python, you'll generate truth tables and analyze functions for symmetry, monotonicity, and other characteristics. Your results will help in designing more efficient, reliable hardware and improve understanding of complex logical relationships within digital systems.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Generate Boolean Functions and Truth Tables**
   - **Task 1-a:** Write Python functions to generate truth tables for Boolean expressions with a specified number of variables.  
   - **Task 1-b:** Implement a method to enumerate all possible Boolean functions for a given number of variables (e.g., for 2 or 3 variables).  
   - **Task 1-c:** Ensure that your functions can handle user-specified Boolean expressions, perhaps using Python‚Äôs built-in logical operators or libraries like Sympy.

2. **Analyze Boolean Function Properties**
   - **Task 2-a:** Develop algorithms to analyze properties such as balance (equal number of true and false outputs), symmetry (function invariant under variable permutation), and monotonicity.  
   - **Task 2-b:** Utilize Boolean algebra techniques to simplify given Boolean expressions, comparing the original and simplified forms in terms of logical complexity (number of terms or operations).  
   - **Task 2-c:** Record insights on special classes of Boolean functions (e.g., self-dual functions, linear functions) and their significance.

3. **Visualization and Reporting**
   - **Task 3-a:** Use Python visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib) to display truth tables in a clear, tabular format.  
   - **Task 3-b:** Generate plots or graphs that illustrate distributions of Boolean function properties (for example, showing the frequency of balanced functions for a given number of variables).  
   - **Task 3-c:** Annotate your visualizations with key notes on observed patterns and insights extracted from your analysis.

4. **Documentation and Discussion**
   - **Task 4-a:** Document your code thoroughly with detailed inline comments explaining the logic behind truth table generation, property analysis, and simplification methods.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Prepare a report summarizing your methodology, key findings, and potential practical applications in digital circuit design or decision support systems.
