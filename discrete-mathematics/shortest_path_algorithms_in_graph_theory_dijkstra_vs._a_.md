## üåç Scenario

Imagine you‚Äôre a logistics analyst working for a delivery company. Your job is to optimize route planning to minimize travel costs. The problem is modeled as a graph, where nodes represent delivery stops and edges represent routes with associated travel costs. To find the most efficient route between two stops, you‚Äôll use Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm and A* search. By comparing the uninformed Dijkstra approach with the heuristic-driven A* algorithm, you‚Äôll identify conditions under which one outperforms the other. Your results will contribute to improved delivery efficiency and reduced operational costs.

## üîß Problem Tasks

1. **Graph Data Structure Setup**
   - **Task 1-a:** Define a graph data structure in Python that supports weighted edges and allows efficient traversal.  
   - **Task 1-b:** Develop helper functions to add nodes, edges, and weights to the graph, supporting both directed and undirected graphs.  
   - **Task 1-c:** Create utilities to generate test graphs or import graph data from standard formats (e.g., adjacency matrices, edge lists).

2. **Implement Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**
   - **Task 2-a:** Write a Python function for Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm to compute the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes.  
   - **Task 2-b:** Ensure your implementation handles non-negative edge weights and efficiently updates distances using a priority queue.  
   - **Task 2-c:** Validate your algorithm on small graphs with known shortest path results.

3. **Implement A* Search Algorithm**
   - **Task 3-a:** Develop a Python function for the A* algorithm using an admissible heuristic (e.g., Euclidean distance in grid graphs).  
   - **Task 3-b:** Ensure proper handling of the priority queue and heuristic calculation to optimize the search process.  
   - **Task 3-c:** Test A* on the same graphs used for Dijkstra to facilitate direct comparison.

4. **Performance Evaluation**
   - **Task 4-a:** Measure runtime and memory usage for both algorithms on graphs of varying sizes and densities.  
   - **Task 4-b:** Analyze scenarios where heuristics significantly improve A*‚Äôs performance and discuss cases where it offers little advantage.  
   - **Task 4-c:** Visualize the shortest paths computed by each algorithm and optionally display the search process (e.g., showing explored nodes).

5. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - **Task 5-a:** Document your implementation with clear inline comments explaining data structures, algorithmic steps, and optimizations.  
   - **Task 5-b:** Prepare a report summarizing your methodology, performance results, and the comparative efficiency of Dijkstra and A*.
