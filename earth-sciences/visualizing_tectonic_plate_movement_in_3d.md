# 🌍 Visualizing Tectonic Plate Movement in 3D

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge involves modeling and visualizing tectonic plate movements in 3D using geophysical data and simulation techniques. The primary objective is to create interactive, dynamic visualizations that accurately depict the movement and interaction of tectonic plates over geological time.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you are a geoscientist tasked with analyzing tectonic plate movements to better understand earthquake risks, continental drift, and other geological phenomena. Using real-world geological data, your goal is to develop a 3D visualization that captures the dynamic behavior of tectonic plates—including interactions at plate boundaries, subduction zones, and rift systems. This visualization will serve both as an educational tool and a research aid, providing intuitive insights into complex earth processes.
