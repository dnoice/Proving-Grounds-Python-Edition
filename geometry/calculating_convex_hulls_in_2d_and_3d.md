# 🔺 Calculating Convex Hulls in 2D and 3D

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge focuses on understanding, implementing, and analyzing convex hull algorithms in both 2D and 3D spaces. Participants will practice data preprocessing, algorithm design, and geometric visualization to grasp how convex hulls operate on point sets.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you are working at an autonomous robotics firm where drones must navigate safely in complex environments. One crucial aspect is determining the minimal bounding shape around obstacles or sets of landmarks. By computing the convex hull in both 2D and 3D, you can efficiently outline these obstacles for path planning and collision avoidance. This real-world application underscores why a robust understanding of convex hull algorithms is vital.
