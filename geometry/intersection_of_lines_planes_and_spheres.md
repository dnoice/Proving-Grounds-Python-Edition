# 🔍 Intersection of Lines, Planes, and Spheres

## 🔎 Overview
This challenge centers on the geometric principles of **line-plane** and **line-sphere** intersections, as well as **plane-sphere** intersections. By exploring these fundamental operations, participants will gain a deeper understanding of how to calculate intersection points, circles, or null sets when geometries do not intersect. The goal is to develop robust techniques for analyzing and visualizing these intersections in 3D space.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you are an **engineer** working on a **robotic arm** used in manufacturing. The arm’s sensors detect objects in its workspace, which are often represented by lines (e.g., laser rangefinders), planes (e.g., conveyor belts or walls), and spherical approximations of parts or tools. Correctly identifying intersections—whether it’s where the sensor line meets a surface or where robotic grippers might contact a spherical component—is critical for precise manipulation and collision avoidance. Mastering these intersections ensures reliable robotic operations and safety.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Line-Plane Intersection
- **Task Description:** Implement a function that takes a line (parametric or two points) and a plane (standard form) and returns the intersection point if it exists.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📐 Represent lines in parametric form (e.g., \(\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{p} + t \mathbf{d}\)) and planes in normal form (e.g., \(\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{r} = c\)).
    - 🧮 Solve for the parameter \(t\) that satisfies the intersection condition.
    - 🔧 Handle special cases (parallel lines, lines contained within planes, or no intersection).

### 🔬 Task 2: Line-Sphere Intersection
- **Task Description:** Determine the points of intersection (zero, one, or two) between a line and a sphere.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📍 Write a function that returns the discriminant of the quadratic equation derived from combining the line equation with the sphere’s equation \((x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 + (z - z_0)^2 = r^2\).
    - 🧩 Interpret the discriminant to find how many intersection points exist (no real intersection, one tangent point, or two points).
    - 🎨 Visualize the line and sphere, highlighting intersection points if they exist.

### 🏗️ Task 3: Plane-Sphere Intersection
- **Task Description:** Compute the intersection of a plane and a sphere, which can be either a circle or a single point (in the case of tangential contact) or null if they do not intersect.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 🏗️ Calculate the distance from the sphere’s center to the plane.
    - 💻 Determine the radius of the intersection circle if the distance is less than \(r\), or identify tangential and null cases.
    - 🌐 Generate a 3D visualization to see how the plane cuts through the sphere.

### 🖼️ Task 4: Combined Intersection Analysis
- **Task Description:** Create a unified workflow to identify and visualize complex scenarios where lines, planes, and spheres intersect in the same scene.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📐 Accept multiple geometry inputs (e.g., multiple lines, one plane, and multiple spheres).
    - 👀 Render all geometries in a single 3D plot, indicating intersection points or curves.
    - 📊 Document any challenges in numerical stability or floating-point precision when performing multiple intersection calculations.
