# 🔄 Transformations in 3D: Rotations, Translations, and Scaling

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge explores the fundamental transformations in 3D geometry: **rotations**, **translations**, and **scaling**. Participants will learn to represent and apply these transformations using matrices, quaternions, and other relevant methods. By the end of this challenge, you will understand how to manipulate objects in 3D space seamlessly and accurately.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you are developing a **3D modeling application** or a **robotics** simulation environment where objects need to be manipulated in real time. Precise transformations—such as rotating a robotic arm joint, translating a virtual object in a scene, or resizing a 3D model—are essential. Having a solid grasp of 3D transformations ensures smooth animation, accurate positioning, and reliable performance in industries ranging from gaming to manufacturing.

## 📝 Problem Tasks
