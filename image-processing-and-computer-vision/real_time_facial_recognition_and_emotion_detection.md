# 🛠️ Real-Time Facial Recognition and Emotion Detection

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on developing a real-time facial recognition system that can also detect and analyze emotions. You will use Python and deep learning techniques to detect faces, recognize identities, and classify facial expressions in live video streams.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are building a smart surveillance system that not only identifies individuals but also monitors their emotional state. Such a system can be applied in security monitoring, user experience analysis, and interactive applications. Your goal is to develop a real-time pipeline that accurately detects faces, identifies individuals, and determines their emotional state, all while maintaining low latency.
