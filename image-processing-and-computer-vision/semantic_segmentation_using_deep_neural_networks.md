# 🛠️ Semantic Segmentation Using Deep Neural Networks

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on implementing semantic segmentation using deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify each pixel in an image into predefined categories. You will use Python to build and train models for segmenting objects in images, leveraging popular architectures such as U-Net, DeepLab, and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs).

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are working on an autonomous driving project where precise scene understanding is crucial for safe navigation. Your goal is to develop a semantic segmentation model that identifies road elements such as vehicles, pedestrians, lanes, and traffic signs in real-time. By accurately segmenting these elements, the system can make informed decisions about driving maneuvers.
