# 🧮 Eigenvalue Decomposition and Its Applications

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge explores **eigenvalue decomposition** (EVD)—a foundational concept in linear algebra used to simplify and understand the structure of matrices. Participants will dive into the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then apply these to practical problems ranging from dimensionality reduction to stability analysis. By mastering EVD, you gain powerful tools to decode how linear transformations scale and orient data or state vectors.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you're working in **data analytics**, where you need to reduce the dimensionality of a large dataset while retaining its most significant features. By computing the **eigenvalues** and **eigenvectors** of a covariance matrix, you can select principal components for analysis. In another setting, you might be a **control systems engineer** checking if an autonomous system is stable by examining whether a dynamic matrix has eigenvalues inside the unit circle. Understanding eigenvalue decomposition allows you to tackle both of these scenarios efficiently and with confidence.
