# 🖼️ Visualizing Matrix Multiplication and Transformations in 2D/3D

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge emphasizes the **conceptual and visual understanding** of how matrix multiplication affects vectors, shapes, and coordinates in two and three dimensions. Participants will create insightful plots and animations to illustrate transformations—shear, rotation, reflection, scaling—showing how linear algebra operations reshape geometric objects.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you are a **computer graphics** developer building an educational tool to help new programmers learn about transformations. By **visualizing** matrix multiplication in action, your users can see exactly how objects distort or move in 2D/3D space. This kind of intuitive understanding is also crucial in **robotics**, **data science**, and **geometric modeling**, where transformations underlie everything from camera calibration to neural network layers.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Basic 2D Transformations
- **Task Description:** Demonstrate the effects of simple 2D transformations via matrix multiplication.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 🔄 Apply rotation, scaling, and shear matrices to a set of 2D points or shapes.
    - 📏 Plot the original and transformed shapes side by side.
    - 🧮 Explain how each element in the 2×2 matrix contributes to the visual outcome.

### 🔬 Task 2: 3D Transformations
- **Task Description:** Extend the visualization to 3D transformations.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📐 Create a basic 3D object (e.g., cube, tetrahedron) and apply translation, rotation, and scaling via 4×4 homogeneous matrices.
    - 🚀 Use a 3D plotting library (matplotlib, PyVista, or Plotly) to illustrate the transformed object.
    - 🧩 Highlight how ordering of transformations (e.g., rotate-then-translate vs. translate-then-rotate) affects final positioning.

### 🏗️ Task 3: Composition of Multiple Matrices
- **Task Description:** Investigate how consecutive multiplications compound transformations.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 🎨 Visualize step-by-step transformations, showing intermediate results.
    - 🔄 Demonstrate the **non-commutative** nature of matrix multiplication (e.g., AB ≠ BA).
    - 🌐 Explore real-world examples like camera pose chaining in a robotics or AR/VR context.

### 🖼️ Task 4: Interactive Animations
- **Task Description:** Build or script basic animations to further enhance learning.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 🎞️ Animate a shape transforming frame by frame under incremental matrix changes (e.g., continuous rotation).
    - 🕹️ (Optional) Allow user input to modify matrix entries and update the visualization in real time.
    - 📊 Document any performance or library-specific considerations when rendering interactive transformations.

## 📦 Deliverables
