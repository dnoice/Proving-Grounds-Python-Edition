# 🤖 Building a Simple Linear Regression Model from Scratch

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge walks you through the fundamentals of **linear regression**—arguably the most basic yet powerful predictive modeling technique. You will build a linear regression model from the ground up, implementing key steps like parameter estimation, cost function evaluation, and gradient-based optimization. By mastering these foundations, you’ll be prepared to tackle more complex regression problems in real-world scenarios.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you’re an **economic analyst** tasked with predicting housing prices based on factors like square footage, number of bedrooms, or location features. You decide to begin with a straightforward linear regression approach. By building your model from scratch, you gain full control and insight into each calculation, making it easier to interpret results and refine your assumptions. This experience will later translate to more sophisticated algorithms and larger datasets.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Data Preparation
- **Task Description:** Gather and preprocess a dataset suitable for regression analysis.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 🗃️ Source a small to medium-sized dataset (e.g., housing or synthetic data).
    - 🧹 Clean and normalize/standardize the data to handle outliers or different scales.
    - 📊 Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

### 🔬 Task 2: Model Formulation
- **Task Description:** Define the linear regression model and its underlying mathematical concepts.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 🤔 Represent your hypothesis as \( h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \dots + \theta_n x_n \).
    - 🧮 Set up the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** cost function \( J(\theta) \).
    - 📐 Clarify the geometry and meaning of parameters \(\theta\), including their interpretability.

### 🏗️ Task 3: Parameter Estimation
- **Task Description:** Implement a method to estimate model parameters, either via closed-form solution or iterative optimization.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📐 **Closed-Form (Normal Equation):** \(\theta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y\).
    - 🚀 **Gradient Descent:** Derive partial derivatives of \( J(\theta) \) and update \(\theta\) iteratively.
    - 🔎 Compare both methods for speed, memory usage, and numerical stability.

### 🖼️ Task 4: Model Evaluation and Visualization
- **Task Description:** Assess how well your linear regression model performs and communicate the results clearly.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 🏷️ Calculate metrics like **R-squared**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, or **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
    - 🖥️ Plot predictions vs. true labels to visualize accuracy on test data.
    - 📝 Discuss any limitations or potential improvements (e.g., regularization, feature engineering).

## 📦 Deliverables
- **💻 Code Implementation:**
  A Python script or Jupyter Notebook where you:
  1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
