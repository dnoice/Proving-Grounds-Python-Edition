# 💼 Building Risk Management Models Using Value at Risk (VaR)

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge focuses on **Value at Risk (VaR)**, a widely used risk measure in the financial industry to estimate the potential loss of a portfolio over a given time horizon with a certain confidence level. By delving into different VaR calculation methods—historical simulation, variance-covariance, and Monte Carlo—participants will learn how to model and quantify market risks, enabling better decision-making and compliance with regulatory standards.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you’re a **risk analyst** at an investment bank tasked with reporting the potential losses of a trading portfolio at the end of each day. Stakeholders need a single number, the **VaR**, that indicates worst-case losses under normal market conditions at, say, a 99% confidence level. Mastering VaR calculation techniques enables you to assess potential downside risk, allocate capital to buffer against adverse scenarios, and comply with regulations (e.g., Basel accords).

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Data Collection and Preparation
- **Task Description:** Obtain historical price data and organize it for VaR calculations.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📈 Source time-series data for one or more assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, or market indices).
    - 🔍 Clean and align data (handle missing values, ensure consistent frequency).
    - 🗃️ Combine assets into a portfolio, possibly assigning weights and calculating daily returns.

### 🔬 Task 2: Implementing VaR Methods
- **Task Description:** Explore different approaches to calculate VaR and compare their assumptions.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 🔧 **Historical Simulation:** Directly compute losses from historical returns at a chosen confidence interval.
    - 🧮 **Variance-Covariance (Parametric):** Assume returns are normally distributed and use mean/variance of the portfolio.
    - 🚀 **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Generate random return scenarios using statistical models or bootstrapping, then derive VaR.

### 🏗️ Task 3: Model Evaluation and Sensitivity
- **Task Description:** Evaluate the effectiveness of your VaR estimations and perform sensitivity checks.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📐 Conduct **backtesting** by comparing VaR predictions with actual portfolio losses (e.g., count how often losses exceed VaR).
    - 🔄 Investigate the impact of different confidence levels (95%, 99%, etc.) and varying time horizons.
    - 🏷️ Document how changes in correlation assumptions or volatility estimates affect VaR outcomes.

### 🖼️ Task 4: Reporting and Visualization
- **Task Description:** Communicate VaR results in a clear, actionable format.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 🗂️ Create summary reports showing daily VaR values and exceedances over a period.
    - 📊 Visualize historical P&L (profit and loss) distributions alongside VaR thresholds.
    - 📝 Provide insights or recommendations based on observed risk patterns and backtest performance.

## 📦 Deliverables
- **💻 Code Implementation:**
  A Python script or Jupyter Notebook where you:
  1. Load and preprocess historical data.  
  2. Calculate VaR via historical, parametric, and/or Monte Carlo methods.  
  3. Compare results at multiple confidence levels, optionally testing different assumptions (e.g., normal vs. skewed distributions).

- **📊 Analysis Report:**
  A concise write-up that explains:
  1. The underlying methodology and assumptions for each VaR approach.  
  2. Key results from backtesting and parameter sensitivity checks.  
  3. Limitations or caveats (e.g., fat-tailed returns, non-stationarity).

- **🖼️ Visualizations:**
  - Time-series plots of VaR against actual portfolio returns.  
  - Distribution or histogram plots showing potential losses and VaR cutoffs.  
  - Any custom plots illustrating scenario analyses or parameter changes.

## 🎁 Bonus Section
1. **🕹️ Interactive VaR Dashboard:**
   Build a small dashboard (e.g., Streamlit, Dash) allowing users to pick assets, set portfolio weights, choose VaR calculation methods, and view results dynamically.

2. **🔎 Stress Testing:**
   Extend the analysis by performing **stress tests**—applying extreme market shock scenarios (e.g., 2008 crisis data) to your portfolio and observing how VaR metrics shift.

3. **🚀 GARCH Volatility Modeling:**
   Model time-varying volatility using GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) to generate more accurate Monte Carlo simulations.

4. **🌐 Multi-Asset Portfolio Analysis:**
   Incorporate correlations across multiple asset classes (equities, commodities, FX) and show how diversification affects overall VaR.

5. **🎥 Presentation Materials:**
   Create a short video or slide deck explaining VaR concepts, detailing your methodology, and showcasing major insights from your model outputs.

## 🏅 Bonus Section Deliverables
- **🕹️ Interactive VaR Dashboard Deliverable:**
  A user-friendly interface where inputs (confidence level, method, data range) can be toggled, immediately updating the VaR estimate.

- **🔎 Stress Testing Deliverable:**
  Scripts or notebooks illustrating how your VaR model performs under extreme historical scenarios, with comparisons to normal market conditions.

- **🚀 GARCH Volatility Modeling Deliverable:**
  Code demonstrating the integration of a GARCH model into your Monte Carlo or parametric VaR calculation, accompanied by performance metrics.

- **🌐 Multi-Asset Portfolio Analysis Deliverable:**
  An extended notebook or report analyzing a multi-asset portfolio’s VaR, discussing how correlation matrices impact risk estimates.

- **🎥 Presentation Materials Deliverable:**
  A recorded demonstration or slides explaining each VaR method, backtest results, and best practices for risk management.
