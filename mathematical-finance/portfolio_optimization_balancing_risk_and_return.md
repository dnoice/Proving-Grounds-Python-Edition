# 💹 Portfolio Optimization: Balancing Risk and Return

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge explores the classic **risk-return** trade-off in **portfolio optimization**. Participants will learn to construct a portfolio of assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, or other securities), aiming to **maximize returns** for a given level of **risk** (or equivalently, **minimize risk** for a target return). By implementing techniques like the **Markowitz mean-variance model**, you’ll gain fundamental insights into modern portfolio theory and how investors optimize allocations.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you’re a **portfolio manager** at an investment firm responsible for creating a balanced mix of assets. You must decide on the weight of each asset in the portfolio to achieve high returns while limiting exposure to large fluctuations. Leveraging historical data, correlation metrics, and optimization algorithms, you can determine how best to allocate capital among different investments, giving clients a stable yet lucrative portfolio.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Data Gathering and Preparation
- **Task Description:** Retrieve historical price data for multiple assets, organize it, and compute key metrics.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📈 Acquire price time series (stocks, ETFs, etc.) using a chosen data source.
    - 💻 Calculate **daily returns** and summarize these into annualized metrics (mean return, standard deviation).
    - 🗃️ Build a **covariance** or **correlation** matrix of the asset returns.

### 🔬 Task 2: Implementing Mean-Variance Optimization
- **Task Description:** Construct and solve a mean-variance optimization problem using historical returns and covariance data.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 🧮 Formulate the objective function to **minimize portfolio variance** subject to a target return (or **maximize returns** subject to a risk budget).
    - 🔧 Use a solver or a library (e.g., `cvxpy`, `PyPortfolioOpt`) or implement from scratch (using Lagrange multipliers).
    - 🏷️ Incorporate constraints (e.g., sum of weights = 1, no short selling if desired, etc.).

### 🏗️ Task 3: Efficient Frontier and Portfolio Selection
- **Task Description:** Compute the **efficient frontier**—the set of optimal portfolios at different risk levels.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📈 Iterate over a range of target returns to solve the optimization problem for each, generating a set of (risk, return) points.
    - 📊 Plot the efficient frontier, highlighting the **Global Minimum Variance (GMV)** portfolio and optionally the **Tangency Portfolio** (if a risk-free rate is specified).
    - ⚖️ Discuss real-world factors like transaction costs, short-sale constraints, or turnover limits.

### 🖼️ Task 4: Analysis and Interpretation
- **Task Description:** Interpret your results, highlighting portfolio compositions, expected returns, and risk.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 🏷️ Report the weights of selected portfolios (e.g., GMV portfolio, a high-return portfolio).
    - 🌐 Evaluate out-of-sample performance or conduct **backtesting** to see how well theoretical allocations hold up in actual market conditions.
    - 📝 Provide insights or recommendations based on risk tolerance, market outlook, or additional constraints.

## 📦 Deliverables
- **💻 Code Implementation:**
  A Python script or Jupyter Notebook that:
  1. Fetches and processes historical return data.  
  2. Implements mean-variance optimization (via a library or custom solution).  
  3. Generates the efficient frontier and key portfolios (GMV, tangency, etc.).

- **📊 Analysis Report:**
  A concise write-up explaining:
  1. Data sources, time horizon, and any preprocessing steps.  
  2. Mean-variance optimization approach, constraints applied, solver details.  
  3. Comparison of different portfolio allocations and their associated risk/return trade-offs.

- **🖼️ Visualizations:**
  - Plot of the efficient frontier, annotated with notable portfolios.  
  - Bar charts or tables showing portfolio weights in selected allocations.  
  - (Optional) Time-series backtest results comparing model predictions vs. real returns.
