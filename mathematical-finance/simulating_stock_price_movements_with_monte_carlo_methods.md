# 🎲 Simulating Stock Price Movements with Monte Carlo Methods

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge introduces **Monte Carlo simulation** techniques to model **stock price movements** over time, offering insights into potential risk and return scenarios. By assuming an underlying stochastic process (commonly **geometric Brownian motion**), you will generate multiple simulated paths for a stock price (or portfolio value) and analyze possible outcomes. This approach is fundamental in **risk management**, **derivative pricing**, and **portfolio stress testing**.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you are a **quantitative analyst** at a hedge fund. You want to estimate how a stock price might evolve under different market conditions to plan trading strategies. By repeatedly simulating price paths, you can observe the distribution of final outcomes, identify potential profit or drawdown scenarios, and refine positions accordingly. This method also helps forecast probable gains and losses over short or long horizons, informing more robust investment decisions.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Defining the Stochastic Process
- **Task Description:** Choose and detail a mathematical model for stock price evolution (e.g., **geometric Brownian motion**).
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 🏷️ Specify parameters like **drift** \(\mu\), **volatility** \(\sigma\), and **time horizon** \(T\).
    - 🔎 Recall the SDE: \(dS = \mu S\,dt + \sigma S\,dW_t\), where \(W_t\) is a Wiener process (Brownian motion).
    - 🏗️ Outline the discrete approximation for simulation: \(S_{t+\Delta t} = S_t \exp\left[(\mu - \tfrac{1}{2}\sigma^2)\Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} \, Z\right]\), \(Z\sim N(0,1)\).

### 🔬 Task 2: Generating Monte Carlo Paths
- **Task Description:** Implement a routine to generate multiple (e.g., 1,000 or 10,000) simulated stock price paths.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 💻 Loop or vectorize computations for each path over discrete time steps up to \(T\).
    - 🏷️ Store results in a data structure (e.g., NumPy arrays) for later analysis.
    - 🚀 Validate or sanity-check results by inspecting a few sample paths visually, ensuring they make sense (e.g., no negative prices).

### 🏗️ Task 3: Analyzing Simulation Results
- **Task Description:** Aggregate the simulated paths to draw conclusions about risk and return.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📈 Plot a handful of paths to visualize potential trajectories over time.
    - 📊 Compute summary statistics at each time step or at final maturity (e.g., mean price, standard deviation, min/max).
    - 🏷️ Possibly incorporate **Value at Risk (VaR)** or expected shortfall to capture downside risk.

### 🖼️ Task 4: Extensions and Variations
- **Task Description:** Extend your simulation setup beyond a basic single-stock geometric Brownian model.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 🌐 Introduce **correlations** to simulate multiple assets or factors simultaneously.
    - 🔎 Experiment with alternative processes (e.g., **mean-reversion**, **jump diffusion**).
    - 💡 Explore calibration using real historical data for drift and volatility parameters.

## 📦 Deliverables
- **💻 Code Implementation:**
  A Python script or Jupyter Notebook that:
  1. Defines a chosen stochastic process (default: geometric Brownian motion).  
  2. Generates multiple simulated stock price paths.  
  3. Outputs summary statistics (mean, median, range, etc.) and risk metrics as desired.

- **📊 Analysis Report:**
  A concise write-up covering:
  1. Model assumptions (drift, volatility, independence, etc.).  
  2. Key observations from your simulated data (e.g., distribution of final prices).  
  3. Potential use cases and limitations (e.g., ignoring fat tails, ignoring regime shifts).

- **🖼️ Visualizations:**
  - Multiple overlaid price paths across time steps, providing a sense of dispersion.  
  - Distribution plots or histograms of final prices.  
  - (Optional) Risk metrics (e.g., VaR) visualized.
