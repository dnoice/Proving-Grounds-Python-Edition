# ♨️ Modeling Heat Transfer in Mechanical Systems

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge focuses on **heat transfer**—conduction, convection, and radiation—in mechanical systems. Participants will learn to derive and implement the governing equations that describe how heat flows through solids, fluids, and interfaces. By understanding and simulating these processes, you’ll be able to predict temperature distributions, identify hotspots, and optimize designs for efficient thermal management.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you’re a **thermal engineer** designing a **heat exchanger** for an automotive cooling system. You need to ensure that coolant fluid picks up enough heat from the engine block, then effectively dissipates it through a radiator. Accurately modeling how heat travels between solid walls and flowing coolant can help you size channels, choose materials, and prevent component failure under extreme temperatures. Mastering heat transfer concepts underpins countless mechanical applications—from HVAC systems to industrial machinery.
