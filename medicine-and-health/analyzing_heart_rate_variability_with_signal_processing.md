# ❤️ Analyzing Heart Rate Variability with Signal Processing

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge focuses on analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) using advanced signal processing techniques. The primary objective is to develop a robust analytical tool that extracts meaningful metrics from heart rate data, providing insights into autonomic nervous system function and overall cardiovascular health.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you are a biomedical engineer or clinical researcher tasked with evaluating patient cardiovascular health using non-invasive methods. Your goal is to analyze heart rate time series data collected from wearable devices or clinical ECG systems, extract HRV features, and interpret them in the context of stress, fitness, and potential cardiac conditions. The results will aid in early diagnosis, monitoring treatment efficacy, and guiding personalized health interventions.
