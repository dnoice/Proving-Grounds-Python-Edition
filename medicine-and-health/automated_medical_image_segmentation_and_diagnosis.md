# 🔬 Automated Medical Image Segmentation and Diagnosis

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge focuses on leveraging deep learning and computer vision to automate the segmentation and diagnosis of medical images. The primary objective is to develop an end-to-end pipeline that preprocesses images, segments regions of interest, and classifies abnormalities, thereby aiding in early disease detection.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you are a biomedical data scientist collaborating with radiologists to enhance diagnostic efficiency. Your goal is to build an automated system that can analyze medical images (such as MRI, CT scans, or X-rays), accurately segment critical areas like tumors or lesions, and classify these regions as benign or malignant. This tool will not only streamline clinical workflows but also support early intervention strategies in patient care.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Task Description:** Gather and prepare medical imaging data for analysis.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📐 Identify and acquire publicly available datasets (e.g., The Cancer Imaging Archive, NIH Chest X-ray dataset).
    - 🧮 Preprocess images by normalizing pixel values, resizing, and applying data augmentation techniques.
    - 🔧 Organize the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets.

### 🔬 Task 2: Develop the Segmentation Model
- **Task Description:** Create a deep learning model to segment regions of interest in medical images.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 💻 Design and implement a segmentation model (e.g., U-Net) using Python libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
    - 📊 Train the model on annotated images and evaluate its performance using metrics like Dice coefficient or Intersection over Union (IoU).
    - 🔍 Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters and using techniques like cross-validation.

### 🔧 Task 3: Develop the Classification Model
- **Task Description:** Build a classification model that uses the segmented regions to diagnose abnormalities.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - ⚡ Implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify segmented regions into diagnostic categories.
    - 🔄 Integrate the classification model with the segmentation output to form a cohesive diagnostic pipeline.
    - 🛠️ Evaluate classification accuracy using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, and compare results with ground truth labels.

### 🖊️ Task 4: Integration, Evaluation, and Reporting
- **Task Description:** Combine segmentation and classification modules, evaluate overall system performance, and document findings.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📄 Integrate the segmentation and classification models into a unified pipeline.
    - 📝 Conduct comprehensive evaluations, generate visualizations (e.g., overlay segmented masks on original images), and compare outcomes with clinical benchmarks.
    - 🖼️ Prepare a detailed report summarizing the methodology, challenges encountered, results, and potential clinical implications.

## 📦 Deliverables
