# 🏃 Building Biomechanical Models of Human Movement

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge focuses on constructing biomechanical models to simulate and analyze human movement. The primary objective is to develop computational models that incorporate anatomical, muscular, and skeletal dynamics to gain insights into movement efficiency, injury risk, and performance optimization.

## 🚀 Scenario
