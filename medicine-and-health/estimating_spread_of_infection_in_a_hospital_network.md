# 🏥 Estimating Spread of Infection in a Hospital Network

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge focuses on modeling and simulating the spread of infection within a hospital network. The main objective is to develop a computational framework that assesses transmission dynamics, identifies potential hotspots, and informs strategies for infection control and prevention.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you are a public health analyst working closely with hospital administrators to control infectious disease outbreaks. Your task is to model a hospital network—comprising various wards, departments, and interconnected facilities—and simulate the spread of an infection through patient and staff interactions. By analyzing the simulation results, you will provide insights into effective interventions, resource allocation, and outbreak management.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Define the Hospital Network and Data Requirements
- **Task Description:** Develop a clear representation of the hospital network and gather relevant data.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📐 Map out the hospital layout including wards, ICUs, emergency departments, and common areas.
    - 🧮 Identify key parameters such as patient flow, staff movement, and contact rates.
    - 🔧 Determine data sources such as hospital records, sensor data, or publicly available datasets.

### 🔬 Task 2: Develop the Infection Spread Model
- **Task Description:** Create an epidemiological model tailored to the hospital network.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 💻 Choose an appropriate model framework (e.g., SIR, SEIR) to simulate infection dynamics.
    - 📊 Incorporate factors like transmission probabilities, recovery rates, and the effect of interventions (e.g., isolation, PPE usage).
    - 🔍 Validate the model by comparing simulation outcomes with historical infection data or literature benchmarks.

### 🔧 Task 3: Implement and Simulate the Model
- **Task Description:** Build a Python-based simulation that integrates the hospital network model with the infection spread dynamics.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - ⚡ Develop a Python script or Jupyter Notebook that simulates the spread of infection over time.
    - 🔄 Run scenarios under varying conditions (e.g., different contact rates, intervention strategies) to evaluate outbreak control measures.
    - 🛠️ Perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of key parameters on infection spread.

### 🖊️ Task 4: Documentation and Reporting
- **Task Description:** Document your methodology, simulation process, and findings.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📄 Write detailed documentation covering the network model, infection spread assumptions, and simulation techniques.
    - 📝 Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing your analysis, key insights, and recommendations for infection control.
    - 🖼️ Include annotated visualizations (e.g., network graphs, time-series plots) that highlight infection hotspots and transmission trends.

## 📦 Deliverables
- **💻 Code Implementation:**
  A Python script or Jupyter Notebook that simulates infection spread in the hospital network.

- **📊 Analysis Report:**
  A detailed report outlining your modeling approach, simulation results, and recommendations for intervention strategies.

- **🖼️ Visualizations:**
  Graphs, network diagrams, and plots that illustrate infection dynamics, transmission hotspots, and the impact of interventions.
