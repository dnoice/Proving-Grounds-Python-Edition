# 🗒️ Solving Linear Programming Problems with Python

## 🔍 Overview
This challenge focuses on formulating and solving linear programming (LP) problems using Python. The objective is to develop a clear, reproducible optimization model that minimizes cost or maximizes profit under a set of linear constraints, implemented entirely in Python.

## 🚀 Scenario
Imagine you are an operations researcher or supply chain manager working to optimize production schedules, transportation routes, or resource allocation. Your task is to model the LP problem mathematically, implement the solution in Python (using libraries like PuLP, CVXPY, or SciPy), and analyze the results to make informed decisions.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Formulate the Linear Programming Model
- **Task Description:** Translate a real-world resource allocation or production planning scenario into a linear programming model.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📐 Define the decision variables, objective function (minimizing cost or maximizing profit), and constraints (e.g., capacity, demand, budget).
    - 🧮 Write the mathematical formulation clearly.
    - 🔧 Validate your model with a simple example to ensure correctness.

### 🔬 Task 2: Python Implementation of the LP Model
- **Task Description:** Implement the LP model in Python using appropriate libraries.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 💻 Use libraries such as PuLP, CVXPY, or SciPy’s `optimize.linprog` to code the model.
    - 📊 Ensure your code is well-documented and organized in a Jupyter Notebook.
    - 🔍 Solve the LP problem and extract the optimal values of the decision variables and the objective function.

### 🔧 Task 3: Analysis and Sensitivity Study
- **Task Description:** Analyze the optimal solution and conduct sensitivity analysis.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - ⚡ Evaluate how changes in constraints or coefficients affect the optimal solution.
    - 🔄 Use Python visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Plotly) to illustrate sensitivity analysis results.
    - 🛠️ Discuss the trade-offs and insights derived from your analysis.

### 🖊️ Task 4: Documentation and Reporting
- **Task Description:** Document your LP formulation, Python implementation, and findings.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - 📄 Write a detailed report outlining your LP model, solution methodology, and sensitivity analysis.
    - 📝 Include annotated code, charts, and explanations to ensure reproducibility.
    - 🖼️ Summarize your findings and suggest potential improvements.

## 📦 Deliverables
- **💻 Code Implementation:** A Python script or Jupyter Notebook implementing the LP model.
- **📊 Analysis Report:** A detailed report explaining your methodology, solution process, and sensitivity analysis.
- **🖼️ Visualizations:** Graphs and plots illustrating the impact of parameter changes on the optimal solution.

## 🎁 Bonus Section
1. **🕹️ Interactive LP Solver:** Develop an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Plotly Dash for real-time parameter modification.
2. **🧮 Extended Problem Scenarios:** Expand the LP model to multi-period planning or multi-objective optimization.
3. **🔄 Library Comparison:** Compare various LP solvers in Python and analyze their performance.

## 🏅 Bonus Section Deliverables
- **🕹️ Interactive Solver Deliverable:** A dashboard enabling dynamic interaction with the LP model.
- **🧮 Extended Problem Deliverable:** A Python implementation addressing a more complex LP scenario.
- **🔄 Comparison Deliverable:** A report or notebook comparing different LP libraries.
