# 🛠️ Analyzing Rigid Body Rotational Dynamics

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on understanding the physics of rotating objects (rigid bodies) and analyzing their rotational motion under various forces and torques. You will use Python to model and simulate rotational dynamics, exploring key concepts such as moments of inertia, angular momentum, and energy.
