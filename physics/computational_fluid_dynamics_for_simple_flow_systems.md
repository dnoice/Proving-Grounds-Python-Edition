# 🛠️ Computational Fluid Dynamics for Simple Flow Systems

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on using Python-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods to simulate and analyze simple flow systems. You will learn to set up governing equations, implement numerical solvers, and visualize flow properties such as velocity fields and pressure distributions.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are a junior fluid mechanics engineer responsible for ensuring efficient fluid transport through pipelines and channels in an industrial setting. Accurately predicting flow behavior is crucial for reducing energy consumption and preventing issues like excessive pressure drops. In this challenge, you will utilize Python to model basic flow scenarios, implement CFD algorithms to solve the Navier-Stokes equations (simplified where appropriate), and interpret the results to enhance system design.
