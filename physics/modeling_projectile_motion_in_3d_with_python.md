# 🛠️ Modeling Projectile Motion in 3D with Python

## 📋 Overview
This challenge centers on understanding and simulating the three-dimensional motion of projectiles under various forces (e.g., gravity, drag). You will use Python to model and analyze projectile trajectories, exploring how initial velocities, angles, and external forces influence the projectile’s path.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are a ballistics engineer designing a system to predict the flight path of objects launched from different angles and speeds. High accuracy is crucial for optimizing trajectories, whether for sports equipment or aerospace applications. In this challenge, you will develop a 3D simulation of projectile motion, accounting for forces such as gravity and air resistance. You will then evaluate the impact of these factors on trajectory shape, range, and landing coordinates.
