# 🛠️ Simulating Planetary Orbits with Gravitational Force

## 📋 Overview
This challenge involves using Python to model and simulate the motion of celestial bodies under gravitational forces. You will explore how orbital parameters, masses, and initial conditions influence orbital shape and stability. By implementing and analyzing n-body gravitational interactions, you will gain insights into both two-body and more complex multi-body systems.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are an astrophysicist modeling the orbits of planets around a star to predict future positions and potential interactions. Accurate simulations are crucial for planning missions and understanding the long-term dynamics of planetary systems. In this challenge, you will develop a Python-based approach to simulate gravitational orbits, examining how factors such as initial velocity, mass distribution, and distance from the central body affect orbital paths and stability.
