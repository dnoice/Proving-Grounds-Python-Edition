# 🛠️ Simulating the Behavior of an Oscillating Spring System

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on modeling and simulating the motion of a mass-spring system, exploring concepts such as harmonic motion, damping, and resonance. Using Python, you will build a numerical model of a single or multi-mass spring setup, investigate its oscillatory behavior, and analyze factors that affect stability and amplitude.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are an engineer tasked with designing a vibration isolation system for sensitive laboratory equipment. Minimizing oscillations is crucial for ensuring accurate measurements and preventing damage. In this challenge, you will simulate different types of spring-mass systems (e.g., single mass on a spring, coupled masses) under various conditions like damping and external driving forces. You will use Python to observe how system parameters—spring constants, damping coefficients, and driving frequencies—alter the system’s response.
