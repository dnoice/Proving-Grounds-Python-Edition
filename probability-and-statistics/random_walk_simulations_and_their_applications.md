# 🛠️ Random Walk Simulations and Their Applications

## 📋 Overview
This challenge explores the concept of random walks and their diverse applications in fields such as finance, physics, and ecology. You will use Python to simulate random walk processes, analyze their statistical properties, and compare the simulation results with theoretical expectations.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are a quantitative analyst or a researcher studying diffusion phenomena. Whether modeling stock price fluctuations, particle diffusion, or animal movement patterns, random walk simulations provide key insights into system dynamics. In this challenge, you will implement random walk simulations in Python, evaluate measures like mean squared displacement, and examine how different parameters impact the behavior of these stochastic processes.
