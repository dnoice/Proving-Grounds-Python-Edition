l# 🛠️ Numerically Solving the Schrödinger Equation for a Particle in a Box

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on using numerical methods to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle confined in an infinite potential well (a "particle in a box"). You will use Python to compute eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, visualize wavefunctions, and analyze quantum energy levels.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are a quantum physicist exploring the foundational aspects of quantum mechanics. Your task is to simulate the behavior of a particle trapped in a one-dimensional box—a classic problem that demonstrates the quantization of energy levels. As you solve the Schrödinger equation numerically, you'll gain insights into the discrete nature of quantum states, reminiscent of the famous Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment (though here, the cat remains a theoretical construct until observed).
