# 🛠️ Navigating the Chaos: Implementing Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance

---

## 📋 Overview
Robots don’t just need to move; they need to move smartly. Whether it’s a warehouse bot navigating around crates or a drone dodging trees, path planning and obstacle avoidance are non-negotiable. In this challenge, you’ll build a robust system to help a robot find the optimal path to its destination while dynamically dodging obstacles.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you’re on the robotics team for an autonomous delivery startup. Your robots need to zip around a bustling warehouse filled with unpredictable obstacles: workers, pallets, and other bots. The goal is to get from point A to point B as efficiently as possible without running into anything – no collisions allowed!

The challenge? The environment is constantly changing, and your robots need to adapt in real-time. You’ll have to balance speed, accuracy, and safety while navigating complex, cluttered spaces.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Map the Environment
Before planning a path, the robot needs to understand its surroundings.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🗺️ Generate a grid map of the environment, marking obstacles and free space.
- 🧩 Implement dynamic mapping to update the grid as obstacles move.
- 🌐 Integrate sensors (like LIDAR or camera feeds) to detect changes in the environment.

### 🔬 Task 2: Develop the Path Planning Algorithm
The robot needs a clear, collision-free route from start to finish.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 💡 Implement a classical algorithm (like A*, Dijkstra, or RRT) as a baseline.
- 🚀 Develop an enhanced path planner that accounts for dynamic obstacles.
- 🏎️ Optimize the path for efficiency (shortest distance, least turns).

### 🔧 Task 3: Obstacle Avoidance in Real-Time
Things get interesting when the obstacles start moving. Your robot must think on its wheels.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🔄 Use predictive algorithms (like Kalman filters) to estimate obstacle trajectories.
- 🧠 Implement reactive control to avoid sudden, unexpected obstacles.
- 📊 Track performance metrics like collision rate and time taken.

### 🖊️ Task 4: Test and Tune the System
Real-world performance matters. Put your robot through its paces in various scenarios.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🛠️ Set up different obstacle configurations and test for robustness.
- 🏁 Measure success rates and compare algorithm performance.
- 📑 Fine-tune parameters to reduce jerky movements and maintain smooth navigation.
