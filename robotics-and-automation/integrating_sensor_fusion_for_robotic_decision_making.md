# 🛠️ Seeing Beyond the Noise: Integrating Sensor Fusion for Robotic Decision-Making

---

## 📋 Overview
Robots are only as smart as the data they process. Real-world environments are unpredictable, noisy, and constantly changing. That’s where sensor fusion steps in – combining data from multiple sensors to get a clearer, more accurate picture of the surroundings. In this challenge, you’ll build a sensor fusion system that enables a robot to make precise, context-aware decisions.

## 🌍 Scenario
You’ve joined the R&D team of a cutting-edge robotics company working on autonomous delivery drones. These drones navigate busy urban environments – dodging pedestrians, vehicles, and other obstacles while maintaining balance and speed. The catch? Each sensor tells a slightly different story. LIDAR detects obstacles, GPS tracks location, and accelerometers monitor stability. Your mission is to fuse this data into one cohesive view so the drone can make real-time decisions without getting confused by conflicting inputs.

## 📝 Problem Tasks

### ⚙️ Task 1: Understanding and Calibrating Sensors
Start by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of each sensor. Know what you’re working with.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🔧 Identify the sensors used: LIDAR, GPS, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), and cameras.
- 📏 Calibrate each sensor to reduce measurement errors.
- 🧮 Normalize data formats to ensure compatibility for fusion.

### 🔬 Task 2: Implementing Sensor Fusion Algorithms
Choose your fusion strategy based on the type of data and the decision requirements.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 💡 Implement basic sensor fusion using Kalman Filters for linear data.
- 🌐 Integrate Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) or Particle Filters for non-linear data.
- 🧠 Use Bayesian data fusion to probabilistically combine uncertain data.

### 🔧 Task 3: Real-Time Decision Making
Put your fused data to work by guiding your robot in dynamic environments.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🚦 Implement a decision-making module that uses fused data to plan and adjust paths.
- 🕵️‍♂️ Incorporate anomaly detection to identify sensor failures or noise spikes.
- 🗺️ Develop a priority system to weigh sensor inputs differently based on conditions (e.g., GPS is less reliable in tunnels).

### 🖊️ Task 4: Testing and Validation
Make sure your fusion system actually improves decision-making and isn’t just adding complexity.

**Sub-tasks:**
- 🛠️ Test the system in controlled simulations with predictable obstacles.
- 🏁 Validate in real-world scenarios with unpredictable movements (like crowded intersections).
- 📑 Analyze performance metrics such as decision accuracy, reaction time, and sensor reliability.
