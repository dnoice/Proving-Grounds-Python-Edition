# 🛠️ Fourier Transform: Analyzing Audio Signals for Noise Reduction

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on applying Fourier transform techniques to analyze audio signals for noise reduction purposes. You will use Python to perform spectral analysis, identify frequency components, and apply filtering techniques to enhance audio quality.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are an audio engineer working on improving the quality of recorded speech or music by reducing background noise. In this challenge, you will analyze audio signals in the frequency domain using Fourier transforms, identify unwanted noise components, and design filtering strategies to remove them. This process is crucial for applications such as audio restoration, hearing aids, and telecommunications.
