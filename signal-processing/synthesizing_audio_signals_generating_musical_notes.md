# 🛠️ Synthesizing Audio Signals: Generating Musical Notes

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on synthesizing audio signals in Python to generate musical notes. You will explore digital waveform synthesis, signal modulation, and the creation of complex sounds by combining basic waveforms, ultimately simulating various musical timbres.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are a digital audio developer working on a new software synthesizer for music production. Your goal is to generate musical notes by synthesizing basic waveforms (such as sine, square, sawtooth, and triangle waves) and applying modulation techniques to create rich, expressive sounds. In this challenge, you will develop Python functions to generate these waveforms, combine them to simulate harmonics and overtones, and experiment with envelope shaping and modulation effects to emulate different instruments.
