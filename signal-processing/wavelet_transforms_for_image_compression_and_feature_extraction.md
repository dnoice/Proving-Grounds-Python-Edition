# 🛠️ Wavelet Transforms for Image Compression and Feature Extraction

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on applying wavelet transform techniques to image processing, specifically for compression and feature extraction. You will use Python to implement discrete wavelet transforms (DWT), analyze their effectiveness in compressing images, and extract features for tasks such as pattern recognition and classification.
