# 🛠️ Analyzing Phase Transitions Using Statistical Mechanics

## 📋 Overview
This challenge explores phase transitions in materials using frameworks from statistical mechanics. You will use Python to simulate models (such as the Ising model) and analyze critical phenomena, including order parameters, fluctuations, and finite-size effects near critical points.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are a physicist studying a magnetic material as it cools down, undergoing a transition from a disordered (paramagnetic) state to an ordered (ferromagnetic) state. Your goal is to simulate this phase transition, identify the critical temperature, and analyze how microscopic interactions give rise to macroscopic properties. This investigation will provide insights into universal behavior in phase transitions and the underlying principles of statistical mechanics.
