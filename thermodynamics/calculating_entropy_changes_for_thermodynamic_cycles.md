# 🛠️ Calculating Entropy Changes for Thermodynamic Cycles

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on analyzing thermodynamic cycles by calculating entropy changes throughout the cycle. You will use Python to model idealized thermodynamic processes, compute entropy variations for key stages, and evaluate the efficiency implications of entropy production.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are a thermodynamics engineer tasked with optimizing the performance of an engine cycle. To maximize efficiency and reduce energy losses, it is crucial to understand how entropy is generated during various stages of the cycle (such as expansion, compression, heating, and cooling). In this challenge, you will simulate one or more thermodynamic cycles (e.g., Carnot, Otto, or Rankine), calculate the entropy changes at each stage, and analyze how these changes relate to overall cycle efficiency.
