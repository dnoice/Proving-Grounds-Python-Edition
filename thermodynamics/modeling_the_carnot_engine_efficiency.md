# 🛠️ Modeling the Carnot Engine Efficiency

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on modeling the efficiency of an ideal Carnot engine. You will use Python to simulate the Carnot cycle, derive efficiency formulas, and analyze the factors that affect the maximum efficiency of heat engines operating between two thermal reservoirs.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you are a thermodynamics engineer tasked with designing a highly efficient heat engine. The Carnot cycle represents the theoretical upper limit for engine efficiency, determined solely by the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs. In this challenge, you will model the Carnot engine, calculate its efficiency based on the reservoir temperatures, and explore how variations in these temperatures influence the overall performance of the engine. This exercise will provide insights into the principles of reversible processes and the second law of thermodynamics.
