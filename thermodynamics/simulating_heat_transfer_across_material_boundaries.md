# 🛠️ Simulating Heat Transfer Across Material Boundaries

## 📋 Overview
This challenge focuses on modeling and simulating heat transfer across the interfaces of different materials. You will use Python to solve the heat conduction equations across material boundaries and analyze how differences in thermal properties and contact resistance affect overall temperature profiles.
