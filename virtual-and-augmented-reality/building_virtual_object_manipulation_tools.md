# 🛠️ Reality Reimagined: Building Virtual Object Manipulation Tools with Python

---

## 📋 Overview
Virtual reality becomes truly immersive when users can interact with virtual objects as if they were real. To achieve this, we need intuitive object manipulation that feels natural and responsive. In this challenge, you'll use Python to build robust VR manipulation tools, enabling users to move, scale, rotate, and interact with objects seamlessly.

---

## 🌍 Scenario
You’re part of a VR innovation team tasked with creating an interactive design tool for architects. The tool must allow users to pick up, move, resize, and rotate virtual objects with high precision, using VR hand tracking and controller inputs. The system should be Python-driven, leveraging libraries like PyOpenGL and Godot’s Python API for real-time performance.

The twist? The system must include automated features that enhance manipulation accuracy, like snapping objects into alignment and predicting user intentions during complex multi-step manipulations.
