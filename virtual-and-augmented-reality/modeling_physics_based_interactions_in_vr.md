# 🛠️ Making Virtual Tangible: Modeling Physics-Based Interactions in VR with Python

---

## 📋 Overview
One of the most compelling aspects of VR is the ability to interact with virtual objects as if they were physically present. To achieve realism, we need accurate physics models that respond to forces, collisions, and user interactions. In this challenge, you’ll build a physics-based interaction system using Python, focusing on making virtual objects move, collide, and respond naturally to user input.

## 🌍 Scenario
Imagine you’re working on a VR training simulator for industrial safety. The goal is to teach users how to manipulate heavy objects safely and realistically. Whether it’s lifting crates or moving machinery, objects must behave according to their physical properties – factoring in weight, friction, and collision dynamics. 

The twist? The VR system should automatically adapt object behavior based on environmental changes, like slippery surfaces or varying gravity, to simulate different scenarios without manual reconfiguration.
